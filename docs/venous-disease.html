<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.1.1</span> Terminology and Presentation<a href="venous-disease.html#terminology-and-presentation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>What is chronic venous insufficiency and how common is it?</strong></p>
<p>So I thought the first question was going to be a nice, easy
uncontroversial one and you’ve landed with CVI. What you’ve hit upon is
one of the main problems with venous disease, which is terminology. So
if you type in chronic venous insufficiency into Google, you end up
with, this enormous range of descriptions and how its used in lots of
different ways, by lots of different people.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that this led to a lot of confusion among people
within the space let alone everywhere else. So really important
documents to guide people to is the VEIN-TERM consensus document
published in 2009.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-eklof2009" role="doc-biblioref">469</a>]</sup></span> The lead author was Dr. Bo Eklof and this
was a document where a whole group of venous experts around the world
got together and said, okay, we need to be clear and define what all
these different terms mean.</p>
<p>And what are the terms that he found was chronic venous insufficiency.
And the official definition is it is a venous disease between C3 and C6
on the CAEP classification. We’ll talk about that a bit later, I’m sure.
But between C3 and C6. In practice, it is used to describe the entire
spectrum of venous disease ranging from thread veins C1 all the way up
to venous ulceration. But technically it is C3 to C6. And I would urge
anybody who is learning about the terminology to look at the vein term
documents.</p>
<p>And silly little things like great saphenous vein and small saphenous
vein–I think UK is the only place where long saphenous is ever used and
the real problem was LSV in lots of other countries will be the lesser
saphenous vein, which is the small saphenous vein. So again, I’d urge
anyone to look at that document.</p>
<p><strong>How common is chronic venous insufficiency?</strong></p>
<p>Chronic venous disease is very common, with the weather getting a bit
nicer, people wearing shorts, you’re spotting, venous disease all over
the place. The studies that have been done indicate that at least a
quarter, probably up to a third of people have C2 to C6 disease. So very
common problem, lots of people that need treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Now we would like to discuss the classification and scoring systems,
you mentioned CAEP, could you expand on that?</strong></p>
<p>So CEAP--clinical, etiological (with an E because it’s American),
anatomical, pathophysiological–classification system was introduced, I
think in the mid 1990s, by the American Venous Forum and American
colleagues. And it’s a classification system.</p>
<p>So if you have a patient that comes into your clinic with a venous
problem, it’s a system to allow you to describe that patient’s current
situation in an objective, clear way. What it does not do is give you
any information about prognostication and it isn’t useful for measuring
responses to treatment.</p>
<p>So it is purely a descriptive classification system. And the most
commonly used bit is the clinical bit, which is C1 one to C6. And again,
CAEP was just recently revised last year, a 25 year revision, which
again, I would urge trainees to have a look at, Dr. Fedor Lurie was the
lead author, and just some useful revisions of CEAP.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-lurie2020" role="doc-biblioref">470</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Now in response to the limitations of CAEP, the Venous Clinical Severity
Score (VCSS) was created. So this is a 10 item scoring system, each item
scores between zero and three. So you get a maximum score of 30. Now
this is designed to be responsive to treatment and complimentary to
CAEP.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-vasquez2010" role="doc-biblioref">471</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>There are lots of other things that have been described, quality of life
tools or VDS, but I would say that those two are the most relevant and
important ones to know about. But many of the QOL tools are too
cumbersome to use in day to day practice. We are in dire need of a easy
to use clinical tool that is validated for assessment of patient
reported outcomes. And again, the number of papers I’ve reviewed where
people have reported CAEP scores as one of the outcome measures in
response to treatments. That is not what it’s designed for, for example,
you can never get lower than C5. You can never get better than a healed
ulcer. So again, that’s the important distinction.</p>
</div>
<div id="evaluation-17" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="9.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.1.2</span> Evaluation<a href="venous-disease.html#evaluation-17" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>When we do see patients in clinic with chronic venous insufficiency,
which type of imaging modalities should we use to investigate the
function and the anatomy of the lower limbs?</strong></p>
<p>If a patient comes to clinic, we can’t underestimate the importance of
the clinical assessment. And when you assess these patients, you really
looking for two things, you are looking for the impact of their venous
disease on their quality of life and the impact of the venous disease
has on their normal function.</p>
<p>But also you’re looking for complications of venous disease. This is a
clinical assessment. But then when ordering investigations, you really
want to identify underlying treatable causes of their venous disease.
And that’s the goal of any investigation.</p>
<p>Venous duplex imaging is obviously the first line, gold standard that
pretty much anybody will go to around the world. And what that does is
essentially gives you information about the flow, both in the normal
antegrade, but also retrograde or refluxing flow in superficial and deep
veins.</p>
<p>It’ll give you information about the anatomy of the veins , which will
help you to plan treatment, but it also gives you lots of other
information as well. It gives you information in the common femoral
vein, for example, if there’s good phasicity of flow or if there’s no
scarring. It helps you to evaluate whether there might be some outflow
obstruction, so duplex imaging is the absolute first line, gold
standard. For more on venous duplex scanning, see <a href="vascular-lab.html#venous">12.7</a>.</p>
<p>Now, once you’ve done theduplex imaging, if there’s clinical suspicion,
then of course we can move on to other investigations. So proximal CTV,
MRV, venography, IVUS, all sorts of other weird and wonderful things.
But clinical assessments and duplex assessment are the bedrock of every
assessment of every venous patient. So that’s the foundation.</p>
</div>
<div id="management-29" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="9.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.1.3</span> Management<a href="venous-disease.html#management-29" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Moving on to the treatment of superficial disease. When we talk about
treatment of superficial venous incompetence, I don’t think we can
really get away from talking about the two major studies, the
ESCHAR[@gohel2007]</strong> and the EVRA<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-gohel2018" role="doc-biblioref">472</a>]</sup></span> <strong>studies, which I know
you’ve been involved with. Can you review what these studies showed and
their importance in the care of our patients.</strong></p>
<p>Before I go into the trials, ’m just going to go back a step and just
talk about the general mindset that’s important for these patients. So
what we’re treating with these patients is not superficial venous
reflux. What we’re treating is chronic venous hypertension. So we’re
treating a global pathophysiological entity of which the superficial
reflux is one correctable factor. And the reason that’s important is
that there may be other correctable factors, such as venous outflow
obstruction or other sort of mobility related things can be adjusted.</p>
<p>But they’re also going to be lots of uncorrectable factors, such as poor
mobility, heart failure, dependency, ankle stiffness. If your ankle is
stiff, you can’t use your calf muscle to pump effectively. You don’t
have that mechanism for clearing the pressure out of your legs. So the
success of these treatments, particularly for the ulcer population, has
to be taken in the context of treating venous hypertension as well.</p>
<p>Having said that the aim of these trials was really very simple. Most
patients with venous ulceration have got superficial reflux. So what is
the role of treating the superficial reflux? That’s the simple question
that was asked by these trials.</p>
<p>So the ESCHAR trial recruited between 1999 and 2002, 500 patients with
healed and open leg ulcers. They either randomized to compression or
compression and traditional, superficial venous surgery, stripping or
ligation. And that trial was very clear. It showed that with venous
stripping there wasn’t a benefit for healing, but there was a
significant and sizable reduction in the risk of ulcer
recurrence.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-gohel2007" role="doc-biblioref">473</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>So one of the criticisms of ESCHAR was lots of people didn’t have the
same surgery. Lots of people had just ligation alone, et cetera. We
don’t really do stripping anymore, it’s all endovenous. So EVRA really
aimed to bring the ESCHAR trial up to modern practice. We randomized 450
patients with open leg ulcers to early endovenous treatments, delivered
within two weeks versus a more delayed approach. What EVRA showed, again
is common sense, if you do with the underlying problem, the venous
ulceration healed significantly quicker.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-gohel2018" role="doc-biblioref">472</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>So put them together clear, unequivocal argument for treating the
superficial reflux in these patients as quickly as possible.</p>
<div id="endovenous" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="9.1.3.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.1.3.1</span> Endovenous<a href="venous-disease.html#endovenous" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Can you broadly outline the different treatment options that can be
offered to patients with superficial venous reflex?</strong></p>
<p>I have counted about 42 different ways of murdering a saphenous vein.
Long and short of it, there are lots of different treatment options. Do
something that you’re trained in and proficient with and something
that’s appropriate. Thermal ablation is in the NICE guidance and in lots
of other international guideline documents has been combined, whether
it’s radiofrequency or laser. Although foam sclerotherapy therapy, when
studied in randomized trials, has lower technical success rates and
lower vein closure rates, the clinical success rates in terms of healing
are just as good. This sort of five, six, even 10% reduction in closing
the vein, doesn’t really seem to translate into a significant drop in
clinical effectiveness.</p>
<p>So I think the most important thing is not necessarily what you use,
it’s doing it quickly and delivering it to the people that need it.</p>
<p><strong>When we are consenting patients for endovenous intervention, what
risks should we discuss with the patient and that they need to be aware
of?</strong></p>
<p>You can spend an hour doing this, if you’re being very diligent. But
what I say to patients are that there are generic risks of venous
thromboembolism is the risk of any intervention. And I think that’s
worthy of specific discussion after endovenous procedures, but I quote a
risk of around one in 200 for most endovenous interventions.</p>
<p>There’s always a risk of bruising. And if you do phlebectomies, what I
often tell people is that bruising sometimes looks worse than it feels.
And with the thermal interventions in particular, I think the risk of
nerve related complications, so some numbness or some nerve pain, are
worthy of mentioned, and of course the risk of recurrence.</p>
<p>Foam sclerotherapy has a different mechanism of action. It’s a detergent
that’s injected into the vein that kills the endothelium. And there are
some people that have associated foam sclerotherapy with some
neurological events. So a very large registry that was organized by the
manufacturers of STS recently looked at 10,000 patients in the UK and
found very few events-around one in 4-5,000. Some people say that if
there is a history of migraine, then the risk of these neurological
events might be a little bit higher.</p>
<p>So, a little bit of caution, although in practice, I’ve treated many
people with migraines. But if you believe the literature, one in four or
five, people have got a little ASD and obviously we treated lots of
those people, so the risks are very low but it’s just important to have
that discussion beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any techniques that we can use to mitigate some of these
risks?</strong></p>
<p>So I think VTE is something that is really worth specifically
discussing. I t’s a very rare event after superficial venous
interventions, but it’s potentially catastrophic. It’s newspaper worthy,
if young people end up having a very bad outcome. What we’ve got to
realize is that the rate of VTE events is very low, there are almost
certainly some people that have got a higher risk. And so what we’ve got
to get slightly smarter about is identifying the people that have a
higher risk of VTE and maybe giving them prolonged course of
thromboprophylaxis, as well as appropriate counseling and mitigation as
well.</p>
<p>So it’s about getting smarter about risk assessment. The current risk
assessment tools are not really fit for purpose when it comes to
superficial venous intervention. So the department of health or the
Caprini tools don’t really take into account some of the really
important factors that I think do impact on VTE risk after superficial
venous interventions.</p>
<p>There’s nothing validated, there’s nothing widely available, but we have
a local, specific risk assessment for patients having superficial venous
interventions. There are major risk factors we look out for, such as
previous ipsilateral VTE, active malignancy, but also significant
chronic inflammatory conditions (i.e. inflammatory bowel disease), these
patients have a much higher risk of VTE than we previously recognized.
There are also minor factors, superficial vein thrombosis, obesity,
comorbidities. All of these things are put together and we come out with
a score. For patients above a certain threshold, they get offered
extended rivaroxaban or low molecular weight heparin. So then we can get
smarter.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to implement mitigation. So traditionally
things like a contraceptive pill, HRT and Tamoxifen, we wouldn’t usually
stop them for a local anesthetic procedure, but being on an estrogen
containing pill doubles or triples your risk of VTE. It’s an easily
reversible thing in the short term that can be done. So for my patients,
I would normally recommend that we stop the pill a full cycle before,
and similarly a month before and after the procedure.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned it an extended course of anticoagulation for those
patients with risk factors. Is there a specific timescale locally that
you use for this?</strong></p>
<p>The venous forum produced some guidance the year before last in exactly
this area. We often only do about a week or 10 days for a lot of these
patients. However, if there’s an ongoing, persistent risk factor, then
actually the VTE risk persists for four to six weeks, and thus there may
be an argument for up to six weeks of therapy in particularly high risk
patients.</p>
<p>However, if they are really that high risk, you’ve really got to
question whether a superficial venous intervention is needed, balancing
the risks and the benefits. But since for some patients the high risk
period persists for at least another six weeks afterwards, be careful
not to stop prophylaxis too soon.</p>
<p><strong>Moving on to a more specific question about treatment, what is the
role for treating and competent perforator veins in these patients?</strong></p>
<p>In most sensible practices, the more advanced the venous disease, the
more likely you are for the disease to be recurrent, the more likely
there is to be deep venous disease or posts thrombotic disease, and the
more likely you are to finding competent perforators. If you imagine
these patients with venous ulcer, it is very common to find perforators,
and if you take a sort of super aggressive role saying you’ve got to
obliterate every single bit of reflux you can find, then you’d be doing
a couple of perforators in every single patient, and that is the
approach of a number of centers around the world.</p>
<p>The pragmatic reality is, number one, if you ablate the superficial
reflux, we know that a lot of these perforators actually become
competent because we’ve got rid of the outflow or you’ve changed the
dynamics in some other way, and they’ve become competent. Number two,
even if they’ve stayed incompetent, the clinical benefit is still there
and is usually still pretty durable.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there may be some people that develop recurrent problems
and then there can be a more targeted approach to the perforator. The
ESCHAR and EVRA studies did not target perforators at all and the
outcomes in the EVRA study was the best healing rate of any published
prospective leg ulcer study. So, putting all that together, it’s
difficult to make a case for aggressive treatment of perforators first
up. Having said that for some people with recurrent disease, it’s not
uncommon to have a big mid thigh <strong>Huntarian perforator or Cocher’s</strong>
perforator lower down on the medial side. So, I do treat perforators,
but almost always it’s in recurrent disease with recurrence or
deteriorating symptoms.</p>
</div>
<div id="open-surgery-1" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="9.1.3.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.1.3.2</span> Open Surgery<a href="venous-disease.html#open-surgery-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>So we’ve discussed quite a bit about endovenous intervention. Is there
a rule for open surgery in some patients?</strong></p>
<p>Open surgery remains the most commonly used superficial venous
intervention around the world, and there are still lots of centers in
the UK that primarily offer open surgery. Being balanced, it’s a very
effective treatments if you do it well and if you use modern approaches
tumescent anesthesia ultrasound guidance, then actually some of the
traditional issues with open surgery, which are often technical and
complication related, don’t really apply.</p>
<p>Having said that all the randomized trials have shown the same thing
while the effectiveness may be as good in open surgery done well, the
recovery is much better after endovenous ablation. So it’s difficult to
make the case for open surgery when you’ve got something that is so well
established and the complications just so low, and it’s cheaper when you
look at their theater capacity, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, I think there has to be a steady drift towards endovenous, but there
are lots of things stopping this. In Germany, for example, the
reimbursement is greatest for open surgery. So surprise, surprise, there
are still lots and lots of open varicose vein operations. And again, for
you guys, if you’re going to change practice, the single biggest driver
for change in practice is reimbursement. If you can, you can change
where the money goes. You can change whatever you like. So, the final
thing is I’ve treated maybe three patients with open surgery in the last
five years. One was a GP, who I had treated the other leg with open
surgery a few years earlier, and she said, “I want the same operation,
please.” So I did struggle to argue with that. The other two were big
three, four, five centimeters saphenovarices in the groin. So specific
indications, but not really for most patients,</p>
</div>
<div id="medical-therapy" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="9.1.3.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.1.3.3</span> Medical Therapy<a href="venous-disease.html#medical-therapy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>So we’ve talked about endovenous and surgical treatment, but are there
any pharmacological therapies that can be used in patients with chronic
venous insufficiency?</strong></p>
<p>So we’re pretty skeptical in the UK, when it comes to venoactive or
pharmacological treatments. If you go to Europe, they love them. They
sell like hot cakes. They’re over the counter in a lot of pharmacies.
The drug with probably the most evidence is something called Daflon,
micronized purified flavonoid fraction.</p>
<p>So flavonoids are naturally occurring, venoactive compounds. There are a
whole variety of effects, only some of which we understand. But a lot of
studies have shown improvements in edema and heaviness. Daflon is
marketed by a French company and it’s got good evidence, but they do not
see places like the UK as a big enough market because of our inherent
skepticism over these sort of things, to make it worth their while to go
through the marketing and the regulatory stuff. So it’s not available.
But patients that have gone to France and picked it up over the counter
and have said it works well. So there may be a rolling and
pentoxyphyllin and these other things—there’s some good evidence that
it accelerates healing of leg ulcers.</p>
<p>But I don’t think we’re very receptive in the UK in general, not in the
vascular surgery community to prescribe pharmacological or herbal type
remedies.</p>
<p><strong>What are the healthcare costs associated with the lower extremity
venous disease?</strong></p>
<p>The educated guesstimates in the UK, NHS, is around 2 billion pounds a
year. The UK NHS budget is about a 120 billion. So, up to about 2% of
the budget, and that’s just C6 disease. We’re not even going into all of
the other diseases, the associated cellulitis, but also not only the
healthcare costs, but the societal costs, the time off work, the other
things. And then of course the superficial vein thrombosis, VTE and
other associated diseases, it’s a massive underestimate</p>

<div id="other-complications-of-superficial-venous-disease" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="9.1.4">

<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.1.4.1</span> Superficial Vein Thrombosis<a href="venous-disease.html#superficial-vein-thrombosis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>You mentioned superficial vein thrombosis, also known as superficial
thrombophlebitis. What is it and how do you manage it?</strong></p>
<p>I’m very pleased you used both terms because I’m going to take the
opportunity to encourage robustly the use of superficial vein thrombosis
rather than thrombophlebitis. The problem with thrombophlebitis is it is
too closely associated with an infectious etiology. And I can only
imagine how many useless courses of antibiotics have been prescribed for
the treatment of what has been presumed to be an infection. Of course,
there’s no infection, it’s a thrombus in a superficial vein. I think
what’s really important is that traditionally it’s been seen as just a
bit of a nuisance and let’s not worry about it, treat with analgesia and
anti-inflammatories, and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>It’s a really sinister pathology and an important cause of VTE. And
again, if you think about it, think of how many thousands, millions of
people that have varicose veins. They don’t all get clots in their
varicose veins. They’ve all got stasis to a certain extent but they
don’t get clots. So it’s more than just the flow dynamics is going on
here. These people are thrombogenic. They have a thrombogenic innate
quality that leads to this. That’s shown out in the study, some really
good work in some French studies. They identified patients who were
scanned with superficial vein thrombosis, and a quarter of them on their
first duplex scan had a DVT. A lot of these DVTs were remotes from the
superficial vein thrombosis. So they’re not all extending into the deep
vein—they were remote—confirming this idea that actually a
thrombogenic problem is going on here.</p>
<p>So in the latest ESVS guidelines, there is quite a lot of stuff about
SVT treatment algorithms. I would urge people to have a look at that,
and it’s important to risk stratify people. The closer you are to the
junction, the higher VTE risk, and actually for anyone other than just a
bit of clot in a varicosity, anticoagulation is the treatment of choice
to reduce progression to VTE.</p>
<p>So look at the guidelines, it’s very clear what we should be doing with
these people, evidence-based, Once the anticoagulation is done, they
need to be re-scanned and that residual incompetent, scarred
thrombogenic, saphenous vein needs to be ablated, otherwise they’ll
recur. So a real change in mindset and level of aggression.</p>
</div>
<div id="bleeding" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="9.1.4.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.1.4.2</span> Bleeding<a href="venous-disease.html#bleeding" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>What’s your approach to managing patients with bleeding varicose
veins?</strong></p>
<p>Really important question. It is a vascular emergency. There are several
depressing reports of patients having died from bleeding from a
varicosity. These are often elderly patients who are frail, who have
arthritis in their hips, and therefore can’t bend down to press on the
bleeding varicosity down by the ankle ulcer. There’s some very grim
photos in various case reports and it’s really sad. There’s two or three
photos that I’ve seen where an elderly patient has not wanted to wake
their partner and so has gone and laid down in the bath with this
bleeding vein that they couldn’t control and basically exsanguinated.</p>
<p>So, it’s a vascular emergency and these patients should be seen and
assessed and their superficial venous disease should be dealt with as
soon as possible. We had an emergency clinic running and anyone with
bleeding veins have the same urgency as the CLI patients and they were
treated there and then.</p>
<p>In terms of the treatment, there’s two aspects: you want to decompress
the venous hypertension by ablating the saphenous reflux, but the
specific bleeding area, I think there’s a real case for some local foam
sclerotherapy. You want to block off that vulnerable bleeding vein to
ensure that this doesn’t happen again. But again, if anyone receives a
referral, these are people to see straight away.</p>

<p><strong>So let’s move on to discuss deep venous thrombosis. You’re recently
involved in the European society of vascular surgery, venous thrombosis
guidelines. In the most part, calf DVTs are managed by medical teams or
dedicated DVT services within the hospital. So in this section, we’ll be

<p><strong>In medical school, we’ve learned a lot about Virchow’s triad and the
etiology of venous thrombosis. Does that simple concept still hold true
today?</strong></p>
<p>I think it does. There’s a few caveats and a few nuances, but I think
the principle that the flow, the vessel wall, and the blood constituents
are the main factors that affect whether or not you get thrombosis in a
vein is still pretty solid. However, there is also a real change in
mindset about the whole idea of provoked and unprovoked DVT. Again, I
would urge people to look at some of the new areas that we’ve covered in
these guidelines.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.2.2</span> Etiology<a href="venous-disease.html#etiology-10" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>You mentioned there about potential risk factors for DVT, and that can
be classified into these provoked, which can be transient or persistent,
and then unprovoked risk factors. Can you talk about some of the
specific factors and causes?</strong></p>
<p>In general, what’s been happening for several years is a recognition
that there are some DVTs that happened with a clear provoking
factor—the communist major, transient, provoking factor is something
like surgery, for example. So a lot of DVT are caused with that clear
provoking factor, but there’s an enormous population of people that
don’t have a clear provoking factor at all, or have a minor factor that
may or may not have contributed.</p>
<p>So traditionally there’s been a dichotomy between provoked and
unprovoked. If it’s provoked, they get a limited period of
anticoagulation is unprovoked it’s long-term. And certainly the last big
thrombosis guidelines was the ACCP guidelines, the American CHEST
guidelines, and that’s what they suggested, but it’s much more nuanced
than that.</p>
<p>What we’ve got to remember is that there are some provoked DVTs where
there’s much higher risk, and those are there’s some unprovoked DVTs,
which actually there may be other factors that you need to take into
account. So I think for those people that are interested in this area,
it’s really important to get to the nitty-gritty. So, long-winded way of
answering your question. But here are some risk factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Major provokes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Surgery</p></li>
<li><p>Major trauma</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor provoked</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shorter periods of immobility - a few days sick in bed with the
flu</p></li>
<li><p>Contraceptive pill - deending on whether it was just started or
the patient has been taking for two to three years</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In the guideline document is a big, long list of other things where for
people to think about it and consider.</p>
<p><strong>In those patients where, after you’ve taken a thorough history,
there’s no obvious provoking factors. Is there a role for screening for
occult malignancies and thrombophilias?</strong></p>
<p>For thrombophilia testing, the history of it is really interesting. When
they were first identified and our ability to screen them first became
available, there’s a lot of excitement because people thought they were
going to be able to identify a clear cause for all of these unprovoked
DVTs. The reality is that at least 50% of them, there’s no identifiable
thrombophilia. So what it almost certainly means is there’s lots of
thrombophilias that we haven’t yet identified, we can’t test for. So it
hasn’t really been the panacea in that regard. The other pragmatic
reality for the thrombophilias is that if we’re going to be putting
people on long-term anticoagulation anyway, the additional value of
testing for these things is really very minimal.</p>
<p>And the ones that are really important—the thrombosis history is so
stark that they normally smack you in the face. So I think it’s
generally gone out of fashion. And again, there’s only very specific
circumstances where we would suggest testing them:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you’re going to be trying to stop anticoagulation, for some
reason, the patients don’t want to be on it, or if there’s bleeding
risks</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a clear family history. Then it might be worth excluding
some of the more sinister thrombophilias.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, certainly not a role for routine testing and similarly for
malignancy—for unprovoked DVT, the prevalence of an underlying
malignancy is somewhere between 6-10%. The studies that have looked at
an aggressive, thorough assessment process rather than a more selective
process, have picked up a few more cancers, but the additional cost in
terms of anxiety, additional investigations, et cetera, and no
demonstrable improvement in outcome has meant that the guidelines have
not recommended routine cancer screening beyond the appropriate age and
sex specific screening—PSA, breast assessments, colonoscopy, etc.</p>

<p><strong>What is the algorithm for investigation?</strong></p>
<p>The most important components is the first component of the algorithm,
which is an assessment of the pre-test probability of DVT. So anyone who
comes with a DVT, you can go through a validated tool. The most common
is the Wells probability score, which is a series of questions and give
you an indication as to whether a DVT is likely or unlikely.</p>
<p>If a DVT is likely, then the algorithm is to do a scan, very
straightforward. If a DVT is unlikely, then the algorithm is to do a
D-dimer. Because if that is negative, DVT is excluded. The guidelines
are very clear on the assessment process, but a lot of this won’t reach
our radars as vascular specialists at all until the DVT has been
diagnosed, so we don’t appreciate the importance of the early stages. So
again, a quick plug for the guidelines, there’s a very nice algorithm,
beautiful colors—I definitely recommend having a look.</p>

<div id="management-30" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="9.2.4">

<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.2.4.1</span> Medical<a href="venous-disease.html#medical" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>So the exact choice and duration of anticoagulation in the management
of a DVT is probably beyond the scope of this podcast, but on the whole
are DOACs preferred over vitamin K antagonists, such as Warfarin and
why?</strong></p>
<p>In a word, yes, lots and lots of studies, funded by big companies that
make DOACs, have been done and they’ve all shown fairly consistent
things. They’ve shown that the DOACs are as effective as the vitamin K
antagonists at preventing DVT. They have almost always a significantly
lower bleeding risk, but they’ve got this enormous added convenience of
not needing regular blood tests, not having this dietary effect , and
the erratic control, et cetera. So the general direction of travel is
inexorably towards more and more use of DOACs.</p>
<p>A couple of other areas where DOACs have really shined: The tendency is
to recommend longer courses of anticoagulation and often indefinite
anticoagulation. A number of studies, both rivaroxaban and Apixaban have
looked at the effect of a lower dose of DOAC in these patients. So if
you need to extend anticoagulation, can you use a lower dose, a
prophylactic dose, so 10mg of rivaroxaban or 2.5mg BID of Apixaban. The
results have been impressive because the prevention of recurrent VTE is
very good, the same as the therapeutic dose, but the bleeding risk is
much lower. So you’ve got this additional benefit of being able to give
an even load those with even lower bleeding risk.</p>
<p>And the real icing on the cake for the DOAC has been a few recent
studies that have been looking at cancer patients. Traditionally cancer
patients where low-molecular weight heparin only, not for DOACs. But the
Hokusai study<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-raskob2018" role="doc-biblioref">474</a>]</sup></span> and the Caravaggio study<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-agnelli2020" role="doc-biblioref">475</a>]</sup></span> more
recently have both looked at Edoxaban and Apixaban in the context of
cancer and have shown that actually they’re very effective.</p>
<p>In almost all of the areas, DOACs are demonstrating their superiority.
The one very notable exception is antiphospholipid syndrome,
particularly triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. This is a pretty
nasty acquired thrombophilia where Warfarin is still the gold
standard.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-pengo2018" role="doc-biblioref">476</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p><strong>Patients with a proximal DVT, in the iliofemoral or the
femoropopliteal segment, is there a role for elastic compression in the
acute phase?</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally people have been a bit nervous about putting compression
on patients with acute DVT, concerns about causing propagation and
causing PEs and all this sort of stuff. A very important study was the
ideal DVT study<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-tencate-hoek2018" role="doc-biblioref">477</a>]</sup></span>, run by a series of Dutch colleagues,
and a number of other additional studies more recently that have built
on the original IDEAL DVT study.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-schreurs2022" role="doc-biblioref">478</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The short answer to your question is that early compression is really
important. It’s a really positive thing to do within 24 hours and it’s
proper compression. It’s not just the Ted stocking and see what happens.
It’s 30 to 40 millimeters of mercury, so that in practice is a class two
stocking with a bandage on top. The benefits are reduces the early pain
and swelling of the DVT, but also interestingly, it reduces the risk of
post-thrombotic syndrome. So if you put compression on early, it reduces
the risk of them developing post-thrombotic syndrome. So a lot of focus
has been on clearing the vein and early thrombus removal and
thrombolysis and thrombectomy and all this sort of aggressive stuff. But
just by doing the compression, we can have at least part of the same
effect and we’ve just not been doing it. Very rarely do these patients
get proper compression.</p>
<p>So there is a big section in the ESVS guidelines about the role of
compression and algorithm as to when, how to use it, and how long do you
use it for. What we want to see now is the DVT pathways around the
country, around the world, updated and amended with this latest
guidance.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-kakkos2021" role="doc-biblioref">479</a>]</sup></span></p>

<p><strong>One of the concerning complications of a DVT, particularly a proximal
DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Can you recap the symptoms of PTS
and how it’s diagnosed?</strong></p>
<p>PTS is a fairly amorphous entity that includes a series of patient
symptoms and clinical signs that develop after deep vein thrombosis.
That’s deliberately very vague, because the condition is so variable. In
terms of diagnosing PTS, the official diagnostic tool is a score of five
or more on the Villalta scale. The Villalta score is another one of
these tools that have been developed for both making a diagnosis, but
also assessing progression of PTS.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-kahn2014" role="doc-biblioref">480</a>,<a href="#ref-villalta1994" role="doc-biblioref">481</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>But in terms of sort of symptoms—people get swelling, heaviness, pain.
There is a very unique symptom, which is venous claudication, which is
almost pathonogmonic of post-thrombotic syndrome with venous outflow
obstruction. It’s this pain which has a bursting tense quality in the
calf on exertion, which does settle on stopping, but it takes a lot
longer than arterial claudication. So sometimes people will take half an
hour to get better and the leg has to be elevated. So that’s venous
claudication and that’s often the most disabling symptom. But of course,
people can develop the same clinical complications than you can with any
venous disease—skin changes, lipodermatosclerosis, venous leg
ulceration, et cetera. Those are the summery of symptoms for PTS, seen
in up to 50% but probably closer to 25% of proximal DVT.</p>

<div id="complications---ivc-filters" class="section level5 hasAnchor" number="9.2.4.1.2">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">9.2.4.1.2</span> Complications - IVC Filters<a href="venous-disease.html#complications---ivc-filters" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p><strong>A quick question about IVC filters. As vascular surgeons, we sometimes
get asked about the appropriateness of inserting an IVC filter. When
would you consider one and how long can one stay in situ for?</strong></p>
<p>So short answer is I virtually never consider one, and if already in
situ, remove as soon as possible. Let’s expand on this a little bit. So
the history of IVC filters is a painful story, particularly in the US,
super aggressive use of IVC filters, very few of them retrieved, lots of
IVC occlusions, and major lawsuits against big companies. That’s led to
a worldwide, reluctance to use IVC filter, so now we may not be using
them in some cases when we should be using them. The traditional
indications and reasons for using IVC filters included weird and
wonderful things like floating thrombus and other factors.</p>
<p>The reality is the only real indication that we could come up with was
when there’s a proximal DVT, and there’s a clear contraindication to
anticoagulation. So if there’s no anticoagulation, then the risk of
propagation and PE is reasonably high, so there is a strong case for a
temporary IVC filter. If a patient is anticoagulated, very rarely can
the case be made for an IVC filter. I don’t want to go into nuanced
details—such as where somebody already had a PE there’s right heart
strain, there may be some anatomical features that you’re worried about,
their anticoagulant control is borderline—there might be specific
cases, but this is really very rare. Most people anticoagulated do not
need an IVC filter.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.2.4.2</span> Surgery<a href="venous-disease.html#surgery-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>So clot burden reduction techniques are a hot topic at the moment.
Before we talk about endovenous techniques, is there a role for surgical
venous thrombectomy? And when would you consider this?</strong></p>
<p>Open thrombectomy is part of the spectrum of early thrombus removal
techniques. It used to be very popular, a very satisfying technique—I
think I’ve done it three times. They’ve all been for the same sort of
indication, which is phlegmasia, severe limb threatening post DVT
change, and in a patient where they couldn’t tolerate anticoagulation
and therefore weren’t candidates for thrombolysis. So you’re with a
patient where the leg is threatened, you can’t anticoagulate them, you
can’t thrombolize them. Then in that case this is a sort of last ditch
approach. But if that’s not the case, then almost always a catheter
based approach is less invasive and more acceptable.</p>
<p>In addition, most people have got more training. Trainees should read
some of the descriptions of open thrombectomy— it’s a very satisfying
technique, but it’s quite involved. It involves finding and exposing the
common femoral, deep femoral and femoral veins, applying tight
compression around the lower leg to milk the clots out distally to
proximally. So the original descriptions are really interesting, but
really very rarely would we need to do that.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-comerota2019" role="doc-biblioref">482</a>]</sup></span></p>
</div>
<div id="endovascular" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="9.2.4.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.2.4.3</span> Endovascular<a href="venous-disease.html#endovascular" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>So you’ve mentioned catheter directed techniques for clot burden
reduction. Some recent trials have challenged our thinking on the
appropriateness of these techniques, such as the ATTRACT and the CaVent
trial. What’s your take on the current evidence?</strong></p>
<p>This is very controversial. The fundamental issue here is that the
trials that have been done almost certainly would not have included a
large number of people who would benefit from interventions in the
opinion of the investigators. So if somebody has got severe DVT, it is
unlikely, particularly in the US, where the ATTRACT trial was done, but
these people would have been randomized into the trial.</p>
<p>So the immediate criticism of the trials is that this is not reflective
of the population. You’ve excluded the people that benefit, so it’s an
underestimate of the benefit of the technique. But if we look at trial
results ourselves, there is a modest benefits. In the CaVent trial, PTS
rate was reduced. The quality of life was less impressive, but the PTS
rate was reduced moderately.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-haig2016" role="doc-biblioref">483</a>]</sup></span> And in the ATTRACT trial, when
they subgroup analyzed the iliofemoral DVT group, then there was a
reduction in the number of people who develop moderate and severe PTS.
So I think the numbers are something along the lines of, you’d have to
treat 10 people with thrombus removal to prevent one person developing
moderate to severe PTS.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-vedantham2017" role="doc-biblioref">484</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>So then the discussion is are those numbers needed to treat appropriate
for intervention? Particularly when you then start to consider the
additional need for stenting surveillance, et cetera. So I think the
jury is very much out and it’s turning into a Brexit or a Donald Trump
like discussion. You’ve got really stark, strong, firmly held
unshiftable views on both sides of the argument and what we need is a
bit of nuance. What we need is everyone accepts that some people benefit
let’s all work together, try and work out, which people benefit. Let’s
work on case selection.</p>
<p><strong>So we’ll put you on the spot then, when would you offer thrombolysis?
Which patients would you offer it in and which circumstances would you
also stent?</strong></p>
<p>There’s no role for thrombolysis in anything other than the iliofemoral
segment. So if it’s infrainguinal, proximal DVT, even if its severely
symptomatic, the studies that actually you cause harm by attempting
early thrombus removal. That’s the first important point.</p>
<p>Even if they have got severe symptoms, there’s always a role for
conservative management, compression elevation and a lot of these people
have a dramatic improvement in their symptoms. If they don’t, and
there’s an honest discussion, and the bleeding risk is low then
potentially there is a role. But when there’s a treatment with a
borderline benefit or the benefit is unclear, then I think what we’ve
gotta do pick low risk patients, so low bleeding risk. We’ve got to
choose teams and techniques with the highest risk of technical success.
And we’ve got to pick people where we think the benefit is greatest,
i.e. those that have the highest risk of PTS.</p>
<p>Whether or not you stent is very difficult. We had a case not so long
ago where we had a very nice result from early thrombus removal, we
stented, and the patients thrombosed again early and subsequently was
identified to have triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. Obviously
there wasn’t the opportunity in the time to make that diagnosis prior to
the decisions around the thrombus removal, so you end up stung and now
this patient has a stent and can be very difficult to open up again. The
advocates and the aggressive stenters would say, you can’t leave a
significant stenosis after thrombus removal, otherwise they will
rethrombose. Whereas others will say, if we go back to the early
studies, like CaVent, very few, if any, people actually had stents, but
actually their results were still reasonable.</p>
<p>I think once you get on the roller coaster of thrombus removal, it’s
very difficult not to then proceed also to stenting, if you see a
significant lesion, for example, at the May-Thurner point. Final
comment, I’ll make is that the use of recanalization and stenting for
chronic PTS is a very effective technique. So another approach, if
you’re not sure, is to manage them conservatively, but always have that
up your sleeve, if they get significant PTS at six months, no earlier,
then we could potentially consider recanalizing and stenting at that
point.</p>
<p><strong>Following thrombolysis, what duration of anticoagulation is
required?</strong></p>
<p>So the whole point of anticoagulation after DVT is to reduce the risk of
propagation and pulmonary embolus, firstly, but also then to reduce the
risk of recurrent VTE. The aims don’t really change if you thrombolyzed
or if you put a stent in. Some people used to say, I put a stent in,
we’ve treated the May-Thurner and that was the main cause of DVT, so we
can stop the anticoagulation. That’s not the case. So it shouldn’t
change and it shouldn’t be any shorter if you’ve thrombolize and put a
stent in.</p>
<p>Now, whether it should be longer because you put a stent in that’s
debatable. Some people have very aggressive anticoagulation protocols
after stenting, but that’s to do with the stent rather than the DVT. So
remember the aims, which are to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE
and to stop propagation of the current event.</p>

Phelgmasia alba dolens is the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Phlegmasia+alba+dolens&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsY3xqSSjZro2T2oiRHzVPLniGwqAQ:1665422481903&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj727ybltb6AhXJoWoFHe3xCsMQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1121&amp;bih=1148&amp;dpr=1">white

leg</a>
and the severe, form a phlegmasia. Theoretically, cerulea dolens has a
limb loss rate of 30-40%--severe limb threat, compartment syndrome,
skin blistering, swelling, etc. The reality is that it’s often
over-diagnosed, so you’ll see a lot of people saying I did venous
thrombolysis for phlegmasia and it’s just a big swollen engorged leg.</p>
<p>The reason it happens is almost certainly a profound obstruction of
venous outflow. So the venous blood in the leg cannot escape. You get
this cycle of worsening pressure, leaking of fluid from the capillaries,
increasing pressure on the soft tissues. Then that starts to threaten
tissue perfusion and potentially if it’s bad enough this will threaten
the actual arterial profusion of the leg as well.</p>
<p>So that’s the sort of most severe and extreme form. I don’t think
anybody has confidently linked the anatomical findings and features of a
DVT to what the leg looks like. There was a patient I saw who literally
had every deep vein acutely thrombosed from the IVC down to both lower
legs and was almost asymptomatic. So we’ve got this very uncomfortable
lack of understanding between the symptoms and the clinical and
anatomical pattern of DVT.</p>
</div>
<div id="deep-venous-obstruction" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="9.4">

<p><strong>So finally, let’s move on to talk about the treatment of proximal deep
venous insufficiency, both obstruction and incompetence. What are the
common causes for deep venous obstruction? Thinking about
post-thrombotic and non-thrombotic obstructions.</strong></p>
<p>So again, the terminology is important. So it’s venous outflow
obstruction. Obstruction implies that there’s a physiological barrier
causing the consequences. As opposed to occlusion, which is an
anatomical term. So venus outflow obstruction, is essentially anything
that reduces the ability of venous blood to escape the leg via deep
venous channels will cause an obstruction.</p>
<p>And again, going back to a bit of physiology. Poiseuille’s Law talks
about the flow rate being the fourth power of the radius. So it’s really
interesting. A question to ask is that if you’ve got a two centimeter
vein, how many, one centimeter veins would it take to carry the same
potential flow as a single two centimeter vein?</p>
<p>The long story short is that it takes 16 one centimeter veins to carry
the same amounts of potential flow as a single two centimeter vein. So
it doesn’t take much of a narrowing to have a great potential impact on
flow. Of course, most of the time, you don’t need that flow potential,
it’s only an absolute extremes of circulatory stress that you’ll need
that sort of potential, but it is interesting. And again, it also
challenges when people say there’s great collaterals and that will be
enough. Well unless they’re enormous, you need 16 of them to have the
same potential blood carrying capacity.</p>
<p>So in terms of the causes, the most common by far is post-thrombotic
disease. So when you’ve had a DVT, one of three things happens. If
you’re lucky, the vein will recanalize completely. If you’re unlucky, it
will obstruct completely. And if you’re somewhere in between, you’ll end
up with partial stenosis and obstruction. What’s important is even if
the vein is open, what you almost always lose in the post-thrombotic
vein is a lack of compliance. It’s not the same compliant vein that can
respond to demands and physiological need that you have, in a primary
non-scarred vein.</p>
<p>Other potential causes are a non-thrombotic iliac vein lesion, or
May-Thurner lesion. So the original paper, 1957, is very interesting
reading.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-may1957" role="doc-biblioref">485</a>]</sup></span> There were a couple of Austrian pathologists who were
looking at kind of various specimens and they identified that a very
high proportion of people, particularly those had left-sided DVT had,
not only the overriding iliac artery causing compression, but they had a
secondary tight fibrosis in the iliac vein. So it’s not just the
compression because any one of us in a certain position we’ll have a
squashed vein. It’s the fact that there’s a secondary inflammatory
fibrotic change, which is what’s causing the obstruction. So that’s a
true May-Thurner or non-thrombotic lesion.</p>
<p>The other big group of patients of course, is malignant lymph node or
retroperitoneal fibrosis related venous outflow obstruction. But
post-thrombotic by far was the most commonly diagnosed pathology.</p>

<p><strong>We may see patients who come in with severe venous disease with skin
changes, for example. When would you consider imaging the proximal deep
veins in addition to infrainguinal superficial and deep veins of the leg
and what are the best modalities to do this?</strong></p>
<p>So we are really getting down to the importance of a detailed assessment
of the entire superficial and deep venous system. Every patient with
venous disease should have a whole leg infrainguinal duplex to start
with—that’s deep and superficial veins. There’s no real role for just
looking at superficial veins. So you need to understand the context. In
terms of if their obstructed or if they’re refluxing. Again, remember
that, reflux on a duplex, yes, all we see is arrows going in certain
directions. But all reflux means is that after a calf augmentation
maneuver, there is some retrograde flow—in a superficial vein, more
than half a second and in a deep vein, more than one second. That’s all
it means. So for example, you can have retrograde flow for 0.6 seconds
in a saphenous vein, and that will be labeled as reflux for all the rest
of the time that superficial vein is doing the right job, it’s returning
the blood to the heart. So just be wary of interpreting what these
arrows mean. For more, see <a href="vascular-lab.html#venous">12.7</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of how that affects your decision-making—one approach is to
consider the overall burden of venous disease, such as those with venous
hypertension. And what I try and do is draw a pie chart and say, you got
venous hypertension, here are the different causes of your venous
disease—that might include superficial reflux, deep venous reflux,
deep venous obstruction, and other factors. You try and apply some
clinical judgment as to what the different factors are.</p>
<p>Now, even if they’ve got significant, deep venous reflux and superficial
venous reflux, there is still a role for treating superficial reflux in
most of these cases. I still come across colleagues and other people who
say, look, you shouldn’t treat the superficial veins if there’s deep
reflux. But all the studies—EVRA, ESCHAR--have shown significant
benefits, even if there’s deep flux.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-gohel2018" role="doc-biblioref">472</a>,<a href="#ref-gohel2007" role="doc-biblioref">473</a>]</sup></span> So again,
the key message is treat the superficial reflux if it’s there.</p>
<p>Now, deep venous obstruction and looking for it is a different matter.
There are again, lots of approaches, some people are very aggressive
about evaluating the iliac veins—CTVs and IVUS on everybody. The
problem is if you get super aggressive, then you start to over-diagnose
and if you start to over-diagnose, you start to over treat and this all
gets very messy.</p>
<p>I think the sort of people that have got clear signs and symptoms of
major venous outflow obstruction, particularly things like venous
claudication, history of previous DVT, really disproportionate venous
changes to the superficial and the infrainguinal imaging. Those are the
people that I would image.</p>
<p>And on the duplex imaging of the leg, if there are changes in the common
femoral vein that make you think there is a proximal problem,
particularly a loss of phasicity of flow then that’s pretty concerning
for a significant venous outflow problem. In an unobstructed venous
system, the common femoral vein should really reflect the right hearts,
which has some phasicity. There should be transmission of that
respiratory phasicity. So if that isn’t there, then you’re thinking,
hang on, there’s something interrupting that transmission, which is
almost always an obstruction somewhere. So those are the people I’d
image, but I wouldn’t over image—because then you end up with a
headache and a problem—Should I treat or should I not treat?</p>
<p><strong>So you mentioned IVUS, what is intravascular ultrasound and what are
the particular benefits of using this technique over venography alone?</strong></p>
<p>IVUS an approximately nine French probe that is inserted into the vein
and it gives you a 360 degree view in B-mode ultrasound—traditionally
without color flow, just B mode—of the anatomical structures. What
it’s very useful for is identifying venous anatomy, confluences,
identifying the size of veins, so it allows you to plan sizes of stents.
It really is an important adjunct to venography and other imaging
modalities. We did our first 30 or so cases of deep venous stenting
without IVUS and thought we were brilliant and IVUS was a waste of
money. And then we started using IVUS and realized I can’t believe we
were doing this without. Once you start using it, you suddenly realize
that it’s a really useful adjunct.</p>
<p>In terms of when you use it, in some parts of the world it’s commonly
used for diagnostic because the risk of over-diagnosis, but more
commonly, almost routinely, for therapeutic, particularly when we’re
stenting deep veins to plan our landing zones.</p>
<p><strong>You talked about over-diagnosis. Can you talk us through some of the
decision-making processes that you go through when you’re assessing a
patient who has a deep venous obstruction?</strong></p>
<p>There are lots of patients that have this anatomical change, the number
of referrals I get from people who have done a CT and they’ve picked up
a problem. The most important thing is the clinical status and the
clinical picture. So have they got symptoms—go about right at the
beginning of the podcast—have they got symptoms? Have they got
complications? If they haven’t got significant symptoms and they haven’t
got significant complications then there’s not really an indication for
treatments.</p>
<p>So leg swelling was initially, frequently pushed as, oh you’re swelling
will get better, if we get rid of your obstruction. That’s only the case
in probably less than 50% of patients. The reason for that is that, yes
the original etiology for the swelling may well have been venous, but
you almost always get a secondary lymphatic dysfunction when you’ve had
swelling, for whatever reason—whether it’s heart failure, whether it’s
venous, the lymphatic system gets damaged. And so even if you get rid of
the original cause, the lymphatic damage persists, of course, and the
swelling persists.</p>
<p>The symptoms are very important and in terms of complications, if
somebody has intractable ulceration, et cetera, these are all important
indications. Butt a bit of skin change, a bit of mild swelling, careful
case selection is very important for these procedures.</p>

<p><strong>So following a deep venous recanalization and stenting, what
surveillance do you offer for these patients?</strong></p>
<p>Surveillance has been evolving. The first availability CE (UK version of
FDA) marked deep venous stents in the UK was around 2012. A few services
across the country really got started at a few centers in 2012, 2013.
Initially there was an early scan and then a scan maybe at six weeks and
three or six months down the line.</p>
<p>I think we realized that in general, the people that developed problems,
often develop them very early. So we are scanning these people the day
after the intervention—obviously there’s intraoperative quality
control and venograms and scanning—but the day after the intervention
to ensure that there’s no early thrombus problems. Then we scan a couple
of weeks after to make sure that there’s nothing that’s happened early,
because there’s an opportunity to re-intervene, to balloon, to correct
any technical issues, at that point. After that point, it’s usually six
weeks, three months, six months, and then annually thereafter.</p>
<p>So that’s a sort of protocol that we have and in general, what we’ve
seen is that people that develop problems tend to develop them
relatively early. So once you get to a year, then in general, the
patency rates are very good. In our center, the the chronic PTS stenting
primary patency rates at around three years are over 80%-85%. Of course,
there are some that have problems, but it’s important to remember that,
even those that have thrombosed, they generally go back to the level of
symptoms they have prior to intervention. Which is very reassuring. The
last thing you want to do is to make people worse with a novel
intervention.</p>
<p><strong>And so what about your anticoagulation and antiplatelet regime for
these patients?</strong></p>
<p>There was a systematic review done a few years ago where all of the
published literature for deep venous stenting was reviewed and I think
the authors identified 28 different regimens for anticoagulation of the
stenting.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-notten2021" role="doc-biblioref">486</a>]</sup></span> The honest answer is nobody knows, our approach
is to have low molecular weight heparin as the primary anticoagulant for
the initial two week period. And then at the two week point, they
undergo a stent. If there’s no issues, they get transitioned to a DOAC.</p>
<p>In addition, the patients get six weeks of clopidogrel as an
anti-platelet. And again, the reason for that is that it’s a foreign
material into the vein. Yes, the role of anti-platelets of renting
venous thrombosis is very limited but there has to be some platelet
related activity and platelet activation involved there. So it makes
logical sense to have some anti-platelet activity. Of course the
downside is that there’s an increasing bleeding risk. These are the
constant tightropes that you’re walking with these patients.</p>
</div>
<div id="surgery-2" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="9.4.3.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.4.3.2</span> Surgery<a href="venous-disease.html#surgery-2" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>We’ve talked about endovascular and endovenous treatments, but is
there a role for open surgery in these patients?</strong></p>
<p>So in the iliac segment, very rarely. In some patients, you can do PTFE
reconstructions and bypasses. And of course the traditional operations
of Palma-Dale<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-palma1960" role="doc-biblioref">487</a>]</sup></span> bypass and May-Husni<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-shaydakov2015" role="doc-biblioref">488</a>]</sup></span> type
procedures. They all sounded very elegant in the books, but the reality
is a great saphenous vein going across the lower abdomen to the other
side is not really going to sort the problem out in a durable way for
all sorts of obvious reasons—the size of the vein, the pressure and
all that sort of stuff. So there’s really very limited role for those
sorts of procedures.</p>
<p>Now, the one area where there may be a role for open reconstruction is
in the common femoral vein. The consistent observation is that good
inflow is absolutely imperative to get good outcomes in these patients.
And sometimes if the common femoral vein has got a lot of scarring, then
it’s very difficult to reconstruct that inflow endovascularly. So a
number of authors have advocated the use of endophlebectomy, opening up
the common femoral vein, and cutting out the scarring and the
tribulations, putting a patch on it. Sometimes even putting an AV
fistula—a little six millimeter graph from the common femoral artery
onto the vein to really drive the flow through the stent. It’s a pretty
complicated operation and you can imagine you’re dissecting down and
there’s lots of little veins everywhere and lots of lymphatics. The
wound complication rate is very high.</p>
<p>So really very limited role only—the endovascular approach is really
the way forward for these patients.</p>

<div id="pelvic-congestive-syndrome" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="9.5">

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.5.1</span> Presentation<a href="venous-disease.html#presentation-12" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>So finally, let’s talk about pelvic congestion syndrome. What is
pelvic congestion syndrome and how does it present?</strong></p>
<p>So it often doesn’t present anywhere near a vascular surgeon. There are
a number of women who present with these chronic heaviness and dragging
symptoms in the lower abdomen. There may be some association with
menses, there’s often dyspareunia and a whole variety of other symptoms.</p>
<p>There may be associated vulvar varices or posterior buttock and thigh
varices all as a result of pelvic venous incompetence. But it’s a
complicated field—there are some people that have pelvic symptoms,
there are some people that have the varicose veins or some will have a
combination of the two. Almost always they will be seen and initially
assessed by the gynecology teams rather than coming to the vascular
surgeons.</p>
</div>
<div id="evaluation-and-management" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="9.5.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.5.2</span> Evaluation and Management<a href="venous-disease.html#evaluation-and-management" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>When we do see these patients, are there any treatment options
available for them? And when would you consider treating?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>n a highly selective way—this is venous disease in a
nutshell—the association between anatomical changes and clinical
symptoms is ropey at best. In terms of postpartum women, an enormous
proportion of these women have got venous reflux in the pelvis—if you
look hard enough. so the problem is that if you start looking for
May-Thurner syndrome, if you start looking hard enough, you start
identifying these symptoms and then you lose the ability to really
discern who’s going to benefit most.</p>
<p>So again, I would go back to clinical symptoms as the single most
important thing. If they’ve got severe clinical symptoms majorly
affecting their quality of life and associated significant venous
changes, then those people to try to intervene on. It’s not necessarily
a benign procedure. Pevlic vein embolization involves implantation of
coils. There’s concerns about non-targeted embolization coils have ended
up in lungs. There are a number of people with unknown nickel allergies
that have problems with these coils. So again, it’s not an area to be
over aggressive. So careful case selection is important. So again, a
quick plug for the ESVS guidelines. There is a very good section on
pelvic venous disease assessment.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-demaeseneer2022" role="doc-biblioref">489</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>What’s very important is again, to differentiate between pelvic
congestion syndrome and pelvic origin varicosities. One thing that is
certainly being advocated is that if the varicose veins are coming from
the pelvis, but there’s no pelvic congestion syndrome, it’s perfectly
reasonable just to deal with the visible varicosities from below—with
some foam sclerotherapy or other treatment from below, rather than being
super aggressive embolizing from above. But I think anybody who’s
involved in managing this really needs to work closely with the
gynecologists. There are gynecological diagnoses that need excluding
before we start to address the venous disease. And there are a number of
validated questionnaires and other assessment tools that are probably
quite important. So not for the faint-hearted.</p>
