  \textbf{What is the definition of crescendo TIAs?}

  The presenting symptoms of extracranial carotid disease is of the
  utmost importance to understand. Focal neurologic symptoms that
  occur suddenly and then resolve within 24 hours are called a
  transient ischemic attach (TIA). If the deficit persists beyond 24
  hours, then it is considered a stroke. Strokes are then graded
  according to the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale
  (NIHSS).\citep{fischer2010}

  A particularly confusing distinction is between a crescendo TIA and
  a stroke in evolution. A crescendo frequent repetitive neurological
  attacks without complete resolution of the deficit between the
  episodes, usually over a 24 hour period. The result of which is the
  same neurological deficit. If the patient exhibits progressive
  deterioration in neurological function between TIA episodes this is
  classified as a stroke in evolution not a crescendo TIA.\citep{ricotta}
  These are both particularly concerning findings and may be an
  indication for an emergent intervention.
\item
  \textbf{Who needs to be screened for carotid disease?}

  Not everyone should be screened for carotid disease, however, as
  only 15\% of patients who have a stroke experience a warning TIA
  prior to their event, there is merit in screening high risk
  patients.\citep{rockman2019} The purpose of carotid bifurcation imaging
  is to detect ``stroke-prone'' carotid bifurcation plaque and identify
  a high-risk patient likely to benefit from therapy designed to
  reduce stroke risk.

  Traditionally, the clinical sign associated with asymptomatic
  carotid stenosis is the presence of a neck bruit on auscultation.
  Focal ipsilateral carotid bruits in symptomatic patients has a
  sensitivity of 63\% and a specificity of 61\% for high-grade carotid
  stenosis (range, 70\%-99\%). As these figures suggest the absence of
  carotid bruit does not absolutely exclude the presence of a
  significant carotid bifurcation lesion, therefore additional
  criteria are used to determine which patients would benefit from
  screening:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Evidence of clinically significant peripheral vascular disease
    regardless of age
  \item
    Patients aged \textgreater65 years with a history of one or more of the
    following atherosclerotic risk factors:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      CAD
    \item
      Smoking
    \item
      Hypercholesterolemia
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  In general, the more risk factors present, the higher the yield of
  screening for the patient. Presence of a carotid bruit, AAA or
  family history of disease alone is not sufficient to warrant
  imaging.\citep{aburahma2022}
\item
  \textbf{Ultrasound Imaging}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    US is considered the best, least invasive, and cost effective
    method for detecting carotid stenosis on
    screening.\citep{shaalan2008} For more see \ref{extracranial}.
  \item
    50-69\% stenosis of ICA - US has a low sensitivity for 50-69\%
    stenosis. A negative ultrasound in symptomatic patients
    necessitates additional imaging. Typically on scanning if 50-69\%
    ICA stenosis is present:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      PSV 125-229 cm/sec
    \item
      EDV 40-100
    \item
      Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio 2-4
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    70-99\% stenosis of ICA- Typically on scanning:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      PSV \textgreater/= 230 cm/sec
    \item
      EDV \textgreater100 (EDV \textgreater{} 140 cm/sec most sensitive for stenosis
      \textgreater80\%)
    \item
      Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio \textgreater{} 4
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Velocity-based estimation of carotid artery stenosis may need to
    be adjusted in certain circumstances:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Higher velocities in women than in men.
    \item
      Higher velocities in the presence of contralateral carotid
      artery occlusion.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    High carotid bifurcation, severe arterial tortuosity, extensive
    vascular calcification, and obesity may also reduce the accuracy
    of US imaging.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Other Imaging Modalities}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    CTA

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Pro - fast, sub-millimeter spatial resolution, visualize
      surrounding structures.
    \item
      Con - cost, contrast exposure.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    MRA

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Pro - no contrast administered; can analyze plaque
      morphology.
    \item
      Con - Does not visualize calcium in plaque; overestimates
      the degree of stenosis (False positive for 50-69\% to be read
      as \textgreater70\%).
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Catheter-based digital subtraction imaging (DSA)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Still considered by many the gold-standard imaging modality.
    \item
      Reserved for individuals with conflicting less-invasive
      imaging or those considered for CAS.
    \item
      Con - cost, contrast, and risk of stroke.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{management}{%
\section{Management}\label{management}}

\hypertarget{medical-management---asymptomatic-patients}{%
\subsection{Medical Management - Asymptomatic Patients}\label{medical-management---asymptomatic-patients}}

First line management for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis is
medical optimization of risk factors. The benefit of prophylactic
intervention (CEA/CAS) of even high grade stenosis is estimated at a
1-2\% stroke reduction risk per year.
\citep{naylorWhyManagementAsymptomatic2015} In addition, keep in mind that
intervention (CEA/CAS) has only demonstrated a benefit in asymptomatic
patient with life expectancy greater than 3 years.
\citep{bulbuliaAsymptomaticCarotidSurgery2017, halliday10yearStrokePrevention2010, rosenfieldRandomizedTrialStent2016}

\textbf{Hypertension}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Blood pressure reduction, with a target of \textless140/90 mmHg through
  lifestyle interventions and anti-hypertensive treatment is
  recommended in individuals who have hypertension with asymptomatic
  carotid atherosclerosis or those with TIA or stroke after the
  hyper-acute period.
\item
  Each 10-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure among hypertensive
  patients decreases the risk of stroke by 33\% in patients aged
  60-79.\citep{aiyagari2009}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Diabetes}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In diabetic patients glycaemic control to nearly normoglycemic
  levels (target hemoglobin A1C \textless7\%) is recommended to reduce
  microvascular complications and, with a smaller evidence base,
  macrovascular complications other than stroke.\citep{ricotta}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hypercholesterolaemia}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Statin agents are recommended targeting LDL of 100 mg/dL, for those
  with coronary heart disease or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease,
  and LDL of 70 mg/dL for very high-risk persons with multiple risk
  factors.
\item
  High dose statin therapy in patients with TIA/stroke reduce future
  rates of stroke or cardiovascular events but not overall mortality
  at 5 years. \citep{karamHighDoseAtorvastatinStroke2008}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Smoking Cessation} - Encouraging smoking cessation is paramount for
these patients. Smoking and carotid disease have been found to have a
dose dependent relationship based on pack-years. Risk of stroke has been
shown to reduce to baseline within 2-4 years of smoking
cessation.\citep{hicks2015, kawachi1993, petrik1995, wilson1997}

\textbf{Antiplatelet therapy} - Single agent antiplatelet therapy, most often
aspirin, is often all that is needed, but this should be weighted with
other cardiovascular risk factors. A number of trials have showed
limited benefit of adding an additional antiplatelet or routinely
testing for clopidogrel resistance.\citep{ricotta}

\hypertarget{medical-management---symptomatic-patients}{%
\subsection{Medical Management - Symptomatic Patients}\label{medical-management---symptomatic-patients}}

Patients who present with a TIA should be placed on dual antiplatelet
therapy, often aspirin and clopidogrel, which are continued through the
workup and treatment of carotid disease. Patients often also have their
blood pressure medications reduced to allow permissive hypertension and
maximize perfusion to at risk cerebral tissue.

While we are not often directly involved in the management of acute
stroke, vascular surgeons should be aware of best practices in this
area. Management of acute stroke currently follow these
timelines\citep{powers2018GuidelinesEarly2018}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textless{} 4.5 hours from onset of symptoms - medical thrombolysis with tPA
  unless contraindicated.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Patient age \textgreater80 and diabetes are contraindications to tPA
    administration after 3hrs.
  \item
    Other contraindications include - hypertension, intracranial
    hemorrhage, recent stroke or cranial trauma, spine/brain surgery
    within 3 months, GI bleed within 21 days.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textless6 hours from onset of symptoms - catheter directed therapy
\item
  After 6 hours, there is limited benefit to thrombolytic therapy.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{surgery---carotid-endarterectomy}{%
\subsection{Surgery - Carotid Endarterectomy}\label{surgery---carotid-endarterectomy}}

\textbf{Indications for Surgical Intervention}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recommendations on when to operate after a TIA/stroke.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Acute stroke with a fixed neurologic deficit of \textgreater6h duration -
    When the patient is medically stable, intervention in 14 days or
    less after stroke is preferable.
    \citep{rothwellEndarterectomySymptomaticCarotid2004, meershoekTimingCarotidIntervention2018}
  \item
    Consider urgent intervention in a medically stable patient with
    mild-moderate neurologic deficit, if there is a significant area
    of ischemic penumbra at risk for progression on imaging that is
    contributing to the patient's presentation.
  \item
    Stroke in evolution (fluctuating / evolving neurological
    deficit) or crescendo TIA (repetitive transient ischemia with
    improvement between events) - If the patient's neurological
    status is not stabilized by medical intervention then an urgent
    CEA should be considered.
  \item
    In this clinical context CEA is preferred to CAS based on an
    increased embolic potential of carotid lesions.
    \citep{rantnerEarlyEndarterectomyCarries2017}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What is the only emergent indication for CEA?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Crescendo TIAs or a stroke in evolution with a surgically
    correctable lesion identified on imaging.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{CEA Intraoperative Techniques}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  General concepts

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Patch angioplasty or eversion endarterectomy are recommended
    over primary arterial closure due to decreased ipsilateral
    stroke, perioperative carotid occlusion, return to the operating
    room, restenosis and 1-year stroke rates.\citep{goodney2010, rerkasem2009} Patch repair is considered the standard of care
    surgical management for most extracranial carotid
    lesions.\citep{arnold2019}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Neuromonitoring/Shunting options during a carotid
  endarterectomy\citep{chongruksut2014, wiske2018}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Local/regional anesthesia with direct neurological monitoring -
    the benefit being that the patient is awake and moving to
    command throughout the case. Indications for shunting include
    lateralizing deficits, seizure, lack of consciousness and severe
    anxiety. Improved neuromonitoring, however, has not been shown
    to reduce myocardial infarction rate with CEA.
  \item
    Stump pressure- Clamp the inflow and place a butterfly attached
    to a-line tubing into the internal carotid artery. If the stump
    pressure is \textgreater{} 50 mmHg the surgeon can chose to proceed without
    shunt placement, if \textless{} 50mmHg then a shunt should be placed
    prior to proceeding.
  \item
    EEG Neuromonitoring - EEG tech places neuromonitoring, monitored
    by the technician and neurologist remotely intraoperatively.
    Generally the surgeon should clamp the ICA for 3 minutes before
    proceeding, if the patient develops neurological deficit/EEG
    abnormalities with slowing and decreased alpha and beta waves,
    then unclamp, await normalization of EEG, then proceed.
  \item
    Cerebral Oximetry - 15\% decrease in either hemisphere should be
    shunted.
  \item
    Transcranial Doppler (TCD) - severe slowing in the middle
    cerebral artery. An RCT demonstrated that TCD and cerebral
    oximetry changes most accurately predicted cerebral ischemia.
    Detection of a greater than 50\% drop in middle cerebral artery
    velocity using transcranial Doppler is 100\% sensitive for
    detecting cerebral ischemia. \citep{moritz2007} For more see
    \ref{intracranial}.
  \item
    Non-selective shunting - the surgeon uses a shunt for all CEAs
    as standard practice, this is often done for all CEAs performed
    under general anesthesia
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Techniques to reach high internal carotid lesions?\citep{beretta2006}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A good knowledge of the available imaging while preparing for
    the procedure is essential when considering the level of the
    carotid bifurcation.
  \item
    Nasotracheal intubation will allow for jaw closure and neck
    extension to facilitate exposure of higher lesions.
  \item
    Division of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle,
    stylopharyngeal muscle, styloglossus muscle, stylomandibular
    ligament or the styloid process. Care should be taken to
    identify and preserve the glossopharyngeal nerve.
  \item
    Division of the occipital artery.
  \item
    Dissection along the posterior parotid gland.
  \item
    ENT surgeon assisted mandible subluxation with assistance if
    previous techniques fail.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What is the best technique for a patient with an anatomically kinked
  internal carotid artery?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Eversion carotid endarterectomy (only indication for selection
    for this technique over patch endarterectomy), transection
    allows for reduction of redundancy at re-anastamosis.
  \item
    Otherwise, no advantage has been shown between eversion or
    patch, both can be shunted.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Nerve Injuries -- where you would encounter these and, if injured,
  what deficit would be seen?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Hypoglossal: Most commonly injured. Usually passes above the
    bifurcation of the carotid artery. If injured the tongue will
    deviate toward the side of injury on protrusion.
  \item
    Glossopharyngeal: Commonly injured during high dissections.
    Found under the posterior digastric muscle. Injury can be
    devastating for patients resulting in difficulty swallowing and
    high aspiration risk.
  \item
    Vagus: Usually found adjacent and lateral to the common carotid.
    Injury can occur with carotid clamping. Patients develop
    hoarseness due to innervation of the laryngeal muscles from the
    recurrent laryngeal nerve which is a branch of the vagus.
  \item
    Marginal Mandibular: Branch of the facial nerve. Runs inferiorly
    to the angle of the mandible. Commonly a retraction injury
    during high dissections leading to the corner of the ipsilateral
    lip drooping, can be confused with a significant neurological
    deficit following the case.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Completion duplex for CEA

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Can identify technical issues with carotid endarterectomy such
    as clamp site injury, thrombosis, intimal flap or dissection, or
    missed disease.\citep{lipski1996}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Acute thrombus may be hypoechoic and difficult to see on
      B-mode, color flow necessary to determine luminal narrowing
      or occlusion. For more see \ref{extracranial}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Revision required if residual plaque identified with severe
    velocity elevation.\citep{weinstein2015}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Elevated velocities can be seen for many reasons that do not
      require revision, including incorrect technique (compression
      with probe), tortuosity, size discrepancy, ICA
      spasm.\citep{ricco2013, weinstein2015}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    One study demonstrated that 2.3\% of carotids required revision
    for concerning findings on completion duplex
    ultrasound.\citep{ascher2004}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Postoperative Complications}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  What to do if the patient develops neuro deficits following carotid
  endarterectomy: Two main concerns- an intimal flap causing
  thrombosis or an embolic event resulting in a stroke. Perform a
  thorough neurological exam to confirm in operated carotid territory.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If in OR -- perform duplex, very low threshold to re-explore and
    confirm patency of ICA with duplex or doppler. If ICA open and
    concerned for distal embolization, then perform a cerebral
    angiogram and proceed with thrombolysis or
    thrombectomy.\citep{fletcher2016}
  \item
    If in Recovery or on the floor -- many would consider CTA first
    line vs duplex to look for thrombosis.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Risk factors and how to manage hyperperfusion syndrome?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Defined as an ipsilateral headache, hypertension, neurological
    deficits likely in distribution of the carotid which can
    progress to seizures and intracranial hemorrhage (75-100\%
    mortality). Can present 2-3 days post surgery.\citep{kaku2004}
  \item
    Patients with uncontrolled hypertension are at risk for
    hyperperfusion syndrome, clinical practice guidelines from SVS
    recommend strict BP control following CEA, with target pressure
    being less than 140/80mmHg or 20mmHg from preoperative
    baseline.\citep{abou-chebl2004}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  High risk groups

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ESRD patients have higher rates of perioperative stroke, but
    also have higher rates of stroke if not revascularized.
    \citep{klarinPerioperativeLongtermImpact2016}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Long term complications and follow up}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recommend f/u US duplex of bilateral carotids at \textless/=30 days. \textgreater/=
  50\% stenosis further imaging is indicated.
\item
  Ipsilateral stenosis

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    0-3mo likely due to inadequate endarterectomy or clamp
    injury.\citep{kang2014}
  \item
    1-3y likely neointimal hyperplasia, smooth and regular. If \textless80\%
    stenosis and asymptomatic, then duplex surveillance and
    antiplatelet. If progresses, then often endo treatment
    first.\citep{garzon-muvdi2016}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Contralateral stenosis:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The risk of progression for moderate stenosis at the initial
    surveillance to severe stenosis in the contralateral artery can
    be as high as 5 times.
  \item
    Requires post-operative surveillance.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Carotid artery patch infections

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Rare complication (\textless1\%) presenting as phlegmon, pseudoaneurysm,
    sinus tract or carotid cutaneous fistula.\citep{stone2011}
  \item
    Treatment is excision and replacement with autologous
    tissue.\citep{fatima2019}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{endovascular---carotid-artery-stenting}{%
\subsection{Endovascular - Carotid Artery Stenting}\label{endovascular---carotid-artery-stenting}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In patients aged \textgreater70 the risk of intra- or post procedure stroke
  was the highest, if undergoing CAS, presumably due to calcified
  disease in the arch.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Lesion-specific characteristics are thought to increase the risk
    of cerebral vascular events after CAS and include a ``soft''
    lipid-rich plaque identified on noninvasive imaging, extensive
    (15 mm or more) disease, a pre-occlusive lesion, and
    circumferential heavy calcification.
  \item
    This risk can be reduced, but not eliminated, by using
    flow-reversal embolic protection rather than distal filter
    protection.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Limited data is available on CAS in asymptomatic patients -
  currently is not supported by guidelines or considered reimbursable.
\item
  Consider CAS in symptomatic patients with \textgreater50\% stenosis who are
  poor candidates for CEA due to severe uncorrectable medical
  comorbidities and/or anatomic considerations:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Ipsilateral neck dissection or XRT - equivalent periprocedural
    stroke rate to CEA, but increased later stroke rate. CEA higher
    rates of cranial nerve damage (9\%).
    \citep{giannopoulosRevascularizationRadiationinducedCarotid2018}
  \item
    Contralateral vocal cord paralysis.
  \item
    Lesions that extend proximally to the clavicle or distal to C2.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Transfemoral Approach vs Transcarotid approach

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ROADSTER Trial - single arm study with flow reversal for
    cerebral protection. Suggested lower rates of post-op stroke in
    patients undergoing TCAR.
  \item
    TCAR contraindications include previous CCA intervention, CCA
    disease at entry site, \textless5cm CCA (clavicle to bifurcation) for
    sheath, CCA \textless{} 6mm, contralateral recurrent laryngeal or vagus
    nerve injury.\citep{kwolek2015}
  \item

    from friable intima of the internal carotid or from the external
    carotid through collaterals. Treatment is external carotid

Blood supply primarily from the external carotid artery.\citep{robertson2019, davila2016} Embolization helps reduce risk of perioperative blood loss
not associated with reduced cranial nerve injury.~ Resection 24-36hrs
after embolization.\citep{power2012}

One quarter (25\%) are associated with a germline mutation or familial
history. Genetic testing recommended in patients with multifocal tumors,
associated paraganglioma, pheochromocytoma or family history.~ SDHD gene
mutation is most common associated with familial
paraganglioma.\citep{davila2016, kruger2010}

Evaluating for carotid body ligation - When involved with a CBT or other
skull base tumors, cerebral perfusion should be thoroughly evaluated
prior to surgical resection to determine whether a patient will tolerate
carotid ligation. Evaluation includes balloon occlusion testing with
xenon-enhanced SPECT imaging. Low risk for ligation if no neurologic
deficits (after 30min and hypotensive challenge) and normal diffusion of
SPECT (ratio of \textgreater0.9).~ Angiography with contralateral occlusion
evaluates collaterals.\citep{sugawara, tansavatdi2015}

\textbf{What are the zones of the upper
extremity?}\citep{illig57UpperExtremity2019}

Division of the upper extremity into three zones:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Intrathoracic Zone: Inclusive of the aortic arch and its branches,
  innominate artery (dividing into right subclavian and right common
  carotid), left subclavian artery and left common carotid artery, as
  well as the innominate veins, and SVC.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Arch classification helps determine difficulty of accessing the
    right innominate from a femoral approach. Type 1 innominate does
    not break the plane of the outer curve, Type 2 it is between the
    outer curve and inner curve and Type 3 it falls below the inner
    curve of the aortic arch.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Thoracic Outlet: Extends from the base of neck to the axilla.
  Includes the subclavian, proximal vertebral, and proximal axillary
  arteries, as well as the corresponding veins).
\item
  Axilla to Fingers: The arm.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What are some common exposures for major upper extremity
arteries?}\citep{illig57UpperExtremity2019, garygwindAnatomicExposuresVascular2013}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Proximal Right Subclavian Artery:} Access through a median
  sternotomy.
\item
  \textbf{Proximal Left Subclavian Artery:} An anterolateral thoracotomy is
  required in emergent settings for proximal left subclavian artery
  control. For proximal, mid and distal exposure is required a ``trap
  door'' exposure is used: anterolateral thoracotomy, third space
  sternotomy, and left supraclavicular incision.
\item
  \textbf{Mid and Distal Subclavian Artery}: Access through a
  supraclavicular Incision. After division of the platysma and
  clavicular head of the SCM, a fat pat of varying thickness is
  encountered which contains the omohyoid muscle. This should be
  divided and placed supero-laterally. At this point, the anterior
  scalene muscle is exposed medially with the phrenic nerve running in
  a lateral to medial direction, which should be identified and
  preserved. In a carotid/subclavian bypass division of the anterior
  scalene should be performed as close to the first rib as possible.
  Once divided the subclavian artery is exposed.
\item
  \textbf{Axillary Artery:} Exposure is gained through an infraclavicular
  incision, below the middle third of the clavicle. Pectoralis major
  is divided and pectoralis minor is freed at the lateral margin of
  the wound. The axillary vein should be identified and followed
  supero-deeply to identify and expose the artery. Anatomically bound
  by the first rib proximally and the lateral edge of the teres major
  muscle distally. For exposure of the first part of the axillary
  artery, the ipsilateral arm is abducted approximately 90 degrees and
  a horizontal skin incision 2 cm below the middle third of the
  clavicle should be made. The underlying pectoralis major is split by
  bluntly separating the fibers, exposing the tough clavipectoral
  fascia. At the lateral wound margin, the pectoralis minor can be
  freed and laterally retracted. The axillary vein is the first
  structure to be encountered in the fascia and the artery lies just
  superior and deep to the vein. Make sure to protect the nerves of
  the brachial plexus which lie deep to the first part of axillary
  artery and are at risk of injury during blind placement of occluding
  arterial clamps.
\item
  \textbf{Brachial Artery, Upper Arm:} The brachial artery's superficial
  location makes it vulnerable to injury and accounts for most
  vascular injuries of the upper extremities. Brachial artery exposure
  involves a 5-8 cm longitudinal incision in the groove between the
  biceps/triceps muscles on the medial aspect of the arm. In the lower
  half of the arm, take care to avoid basilic vein damage as it runs
  in the subcutaneous tissue. The neurovascular bundle is exposed by
  incising the deep fascia at the medial border of the biceps muscle,
  which then should be retracted anteriorly. The basilic vein should
  be identified and retracted into the posterior wound. On opening the
  brachial sheath the median nerve is the most superficial structure
  and should be identified, protected and retracted. The brachial
  artery lies deep to the median nerve and is flanked by two brachial
  veins. Be mindful that the ulnar nerve lies posteriorly.
\item
  \textbf{Brachial Artery, Antecubital Fossa:} Exposure of the brachial
  artery in the antecubital fossa requires a transverse skin incision
  1 cm distal to the midpoint of the antecubital crease. After
  deepening, mobilize the basilic vein medially to avoid injury. The
  medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve should be identified and
  protected. The bicipital aponeurosis should be divided to exposure
  the brachial artery, which is flanked by two deep veins crossing
  tributaries. To isolate the brachial artery ligation and division of
  these tributaries is required. The brachial artery bifurcates at the
  radial tuberosity into its radial and ulnar branches. Immediately
  after the ulnar artery arises from the bifurcation origin, it gives
  off a short common interosseous branch, which bifurcates at the
  hiatus in the proximal interosseous membrane.
\item
  \textbf{Radial Artery at the Wrist:} This requires a 2-3 cm longitudinal
  incision generally between the palpable radial artery and cephalic
  vein. Incision of the antebrachial fascia medially to the radius
  should expose the radial artery. Two veins accompany the artery and
  should be dissected away to isolate the artery. The superficial
  radial nerve and its medial/lateral branches course between the
  cephalic vein and radial artery in this area.
\item
  \textbf{Ulnar Artery:} The ulnar artery courses beneath the superficial
  flexor muscles of the proximal forearm, emerging near the ulnar
  border at the midpoint between the elbow and the wrist. In the
  distal forearm, the ulnar artery runs just deep to the antebrachial
  fascia and is easily exposed through a longitudinal incision placed
  radially to the flexor carpi ulnaris. The palmar branch of the ulnar
  nerve courses superficially to the antebrachial fascia and should be
  preserved during arterial exposure to avoid injury.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What common aberrant upper extremity/arch anatomy is important to be
aware of?}

Thoracic aortic disease is associated with aberrant anatomy, with high
rates of bovine arch (25\%), isolated L vertebral (6-8\%), and aberrant R
subclavian (1-2\%).\citep{dumfarth2015}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Bovine Arch:} Where the innominate and left common carotid
  arteries share a common origin.\citep{layton2006}
\item
  \textbf{Aberrant Vertebral Artery:} Where the vertebral artery arises
  directly from the aortic arch.
\item
  \textbf{Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery:} Where there is no innominate
  artery and instead the right common carotid arises directly from the
  aorta. Confusingly the right subclavian artery, then originates from
  the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian artery. To supply the
  right arm it therefore, needs to pass behind the esophagus.

\textbf{What is the procedure of choice in acute limb ischemia of the upper
extremity?}

With acute presentation of upper limb ischemia and a localizing
examination, may be reasonable to proceed directly to OR for embolectomy
to minimize ischemia time.\citep{wahlberg2006, henke2009}

\textbf{What are some postoperative complications of an embolectomy for acute
limb ischemia?}

Brachial sheath hematoma - parasthesias and weakness in the median nerve
distribution require emergent re-exploration and decompression. Even
small hematomas that are not readily identifiable on clinical exam, can
cause compression on the median nerve and are a surgical
emergency.\citep{tran2011}

Compartment Syndrome - If prolonged ischemia or no hematoma found, and
forearm compartments appear tense, then should proceed with fasciotomies
to treat forearm compartment syndrome. Rarely performed prophylactically
due to significant morbidity.\citep{gelberman1981, kistler2018, leversedge2011}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Three compartments - forearm volar (flexor, superficial, and deep),
  mobile wad (lateral), and dorsal (extensor, superficial, and deep).
  Volar compartments most susceptible to ischemia and compartment
  syndrome, most vulnerable muscle are flexor digitorum profundas and
  flexor pollicus longus.\citep{ronel2004}
\item
  Volar/Henry approach decompresses lateral and volar compartments
  with a single incision, includes carpal tunnel release.

  Etiology: Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of
  subclavian/axillary occlusive disease. Left SCA \textgreater{} Right
  involvement. Less common causes include Takayasu disease, giant cell
  arteritis, or arterial TOS
\item
  Symptoms: Upper extremity arm/hand ischemia or neurologic symptoms

\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are causes and symptoms associated with brachial/forearm
occlusive disease?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Etiology: MCC of brachial artery occlusion is cardiac origin
  embolus. Atherosclerosis RARELY affects the brachial artery. Distal
  axillary/proximal brachial stenosis can be from repetitive trauma
  from crutch use.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Radiation arteritis - may be seen with radiation after breast

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Endovascular with balloon expandable stent via femoral or
  ipsilateral brachial artery.
  \citep{chatterjeeAngioplastyAloneAngioplasty2013, bradaricEndovascularTherapyStenoOcclusive2015, sahaSubclavianArteryDisease2017, palchik2008, mordasini2011}
  Preferred in:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Short segment or ostial disease with adequate distance to the
    vertebral artery origin.
  \item
    History of neck surgery or radiation.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Surgery:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Bypass from aortic arch through median sternotomy - Most durable
    option, particularly for dense R innominate disease, so
    preferred in patients who can tolerate. Endarterectomy not
    appropriate if disease involves the origin.\citep{aiello2011, mansukhani2018, berguer1998, daniel2014, reul1991, berguer1999, byrne2007}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Complications include compression of the graft on sternal
      closure, so proximal anastomosis should be placed to the
      side of the aorta.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Ipsilateral CCA to subclavian artery (bypass or transposition) -
    Recent NSQIP study showed no difference in stroke and death for
    CS bypass vs transposition, therefore procedure should be
    determined by anatomic constraints.\citep{cinà2002, vandervliet1995}
    Small studies and systematic reviews have shown that patency of
    carotid subclavian bypass is better with synthetic graft than
    with autologous vein.\citep{aburahma2000, illuminati2018, ziomek1986}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      An additional indication for carotid subclavian bypass is as
      a staged revascularization prior to TEVAR for aneurysmal
      disease requiring coverage of the LSA
    \item
      \textbf{How does the exposure differentiate in transposition vs
      bypass?}

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Arterial transposition via a short, transverse cervical
        incision above the clavicle between two heads of SCM
        (bypass is lateral to entire SCM)
      \item
        Sub-platysmal flaps created and avoid EJ vein damage
      \item
        Omohypoid divided between heads of SCM and IJ mobilized
        laterally (bypass IJ is mobilized medially to expose CCA
        and care must be taken to avoid phrenic nerve in more
        lateral approach)
      \item
        CCA is reflected medially with vagus nerve
      \item
        On the left side, the thoracic duct is identifiable and
        divided followed by dividing the vertebral vein
      \item
        Subclavian artery and proximal branches identified
        (anterior scalene is in lateral dissection)
      \end{itemize}
    \item

      subclavian bypass in order of highest to lowest incidence?}

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
      \item
        Phrenic nerve palsy (most common) - most often managed
        conservatively.
      \item
        Recurrent laryngeal palsy
      \item
        Lymphatic leak

      transposition?}

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
      \item
        Vertebral artery takes origin from the subclavian artery
        in a very proximal position or is dominant over the
        contralateral side, then bypass preferred.
        \citep{moraschTechniqueSubclavianCarotid2009d}
      \item
        For coronary-subclavian steal with patent internal
        mammary artery to coronary artery bypass graft, then
        Bypass (a carotid-subclavian transposition requires a
        more proximal clamp with occlusion of inline antegrade
        flow to the coronary bypass during the procedure)
        \citep{cuaReviewCoronarySubclavian2017}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Contralateral CCA (anterior or retropharyngeal)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Brachial/forearm Occlusive disease

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Endovascular: PTA evidence is anecdotal with stents for lesions
  unresponsive to PTA or dissection following angioplasty.\citep{cheun2019, nasser2014, dineen2007}
\item
  Surgery: GSV vein bypass remains standard for revascularization with
  bypasses to superficial or deep palmar arch have good patency rates.
  Tunneling is subcutaneous if to distal ulnar or superficial palmar
  arch whereas anatomical to distal radial artery over the anatomic
  snuffbox.\citep{chang2003, masden2012, spinelli2010}

\textbf{You are called to the intensive care unit for a septic patient with
acute bilateral upper limb ischemia, what is the management strategy?}

Critically ill patients on vasopressors with bilateral upper extremity
ischemia are often managed best with supportive measures and attempts to
wean vasopressors (especially norepinephrine).\citep{landry2018}

Limited role for radial artery embolectomy, only in clear ischemia
isolated to the distribution of an occluded radial artery, often
secondary to line placement.\citep{valentine2005}

\hypertarget{raynauds-phenomenon}{%
\subsection{Raynaud's Phenomenon}\label{raynauds-phenomenon}}

\textbf{What is Raynaud's and what causes it?} \citep{shuja117UpperExtremity, landry141RaynaudPhenomenon2019}

Exaggeration of normal physiologic response with episodic pallor or
cyanosis of the fingers caused by small digital artery vasoconstriction
occurring in response to cold or emotional stress. There is an
abnormality with sympathetic nervous system, resulting in a
multifactorial problem involving a combination of vascular, neural, and
humoral factors.

\textbf{What are the subtypes of Raynaud's phenomenon and what is the
underlying pathology?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Primary: Raynaud's disease-idiopathic form that is a benign process
  not associated with structural vascular change. Triggers include
  (cold, emotional stress, caffeine) resulting in digital smooth
  muscle contraction and temporary digital hypoperfusion.
\item
  Secondary: Fixed vascular obstruction to blood flow decreasing
  threshold for cold induced vasospasm or progress to tissue loss.
  Diseases associated include mixed connective tissue disease, SLE,
  and rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma (accounts for 80-90\% of
  cases). In setting of lower digital blood pressure, symptomatic
  digital ischemia or tissue loss under low stress conditions. With
  cold/emotional stress, vasoconstrictive response of digital artery
  smooth muscle further causes arterial closure and resultant symptoms
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What are diagnostic criteria for Raynaud's?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Clinical (Progression of ischemia with white -\textgreater{} blue -\textgreater{} red finger
  discoloration. Episodes can be self-limited and may last from less
  than a minute, but generally not longer than 10-20 minutes
\item
  Qualitative testing for severity of cold sensitivity in Raynaud's
  syndrome can be useful. Most basic test is cold sensitivity and
  recovery after ice water immersion. \textgreater10 minutes return to baseline
  pressure concerning for Raynaud's
\item
  Segmental pressures with finger systolic blood pressure can
  differentiate purely vasospastic vs occlusive disease. Difference of
  more than 15 mm Hg between fingers or absolute finger pressure \textless70
  mm Hg may indicate occlusive disease
\item
  Serologic evaluation (ANA/RF)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are appropriate treatments for Raynaud's phenomenon?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Medical-cold/tobacco avoidance lead to improvement in around half of
  patients. Calcium channel blocker (nifedipine ER 30mg qday) and
  losartan (50mg BID) have been shown to be most
  effective.\citep{landry2013, wigley2016} Other drugs include alpha
  blocker, sildenafil, fluoxetine (SSRI), reserpine, cilostazol,
  captopril.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    OUTCOMES ARE POOR IN PATIENTS WITH ARTERIAL OBSTRUCTION. If
    there is an asymmetric vascular examination, then further
    non-invasive vascular imaging is needed.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Surgical-thoracic sympathectomy (used for treatment of digital
  artery vasospasm/digital ischemic ulceration). For vasospasm,
  thoracic sympathectomy is initially successful, but symptoms return
  generally within 3-6 months.
\item
  Immunosuppression/immunomodulation for connective tissue disorders
  associated with secondary Raynaud phenomenon
\end{enumerate}

See Landry's Review in JVS for a good treatment algorithm.\citep{landry2013}

\hypertarget{ergotism}{%
\subsection{Ergotism}\label{ergotism}}

\textbf{What is Ergotism?} \citep{jamescstanleyCurrentTherapyVascular2014}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Etiology: Ergot is a parasitic fungal disease that has a particular
  prevalence for infecting rye plants and ergot alkaloids have been
  linked to epidemic poisonings that manifested as ergotism from
  consumption of rye
\item
  Modern day is rare
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What causes Ergotism and how do patients present?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ergotamine is chemically like endogenous catecholamines/indolamines
  and when applied clinically, it behaves as an agonist to
  alpha-adrenergic, sertoninergic, and dopaminergic receptors. Despite
  limited bioavailability, vasocontrictive effects have been reported
  to last for 24 hours or longer
\item
  Gangrenous-mild limb pain followed by burning pain/shooting and
\item
  Convulsive-heaviness in limbs and head associated with diarrhea.
  Could result in tonic-clonic spasms
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How can you diagnose Ergotism and what is the process for treating
this disease?}

Upper extremity ischemia (i.e.~digital ulceration) in the setting of
ergot alkaloid use (typically for migraines). The treatment includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Volume expansion and IV heparin as anticoagulation
\item
  IV infusion of nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, iloprost or combination
\item
  Infusion of Ca 2+ channel blockers
\item
  Surgical: for thrombosis, consider thrombolysis
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{buergers-disease}{%
\subsection{Buerger's Disease}\label{buergers-disease}}

\textbf{How is Buerger's disease categorized?}

Non-atherosclerotic, segmental, inflammatory disease of small/medium
sized arteries in distal extremities of tobacco users distinct from
either atherosclerosis of immune
arteritis\citep{jacklcronenwettVascularDecisionMaking2020, lejoncour2018}

\textbf{What clinical criteria can help diagnose Buerger's?}

Smoking history, onset before 50 years, infrapopliteal arterial
occlusions, upper limb involvement, absence of atherosclerotic risk
factors besides smoking

\textbf{What is important about diagnosing Buerger's}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Typically a diagnosis of exclusion
\item
  Must rule out proximal embolic source, trauma, local lesions (e.g.
  pop entrapment or cystic adventitial disease), autoimmune disease,
  hypercoagulable status, atherosclerosis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What physical exam and non-invasive/invasive imaging findings of
Buerger's?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Distal, but not proximal arterial disease (palpable
  brachial/popliteal but absent/reduced at ankle or wrist)
\item
  DBI\textless0.6 and flat/reduced digital waveforms
\item
  CTA/MRA/DSA or duplex - characteristic findings of
  serpiginous/corkscrew collaterals, occlusion of distal calf/pedal
  arteries, and normal proximal arteries.\citep{busch2011, fujii2011}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the mainstay treatment in Buerger's disease?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Smoking cessation! Only treatment to improve symptoms and reduce
  amputation risk if achieved before onset of gangrene or tissue loss.
  Important to remember following treatments will likely fail without
  smoking cessation.
\item
  If smoking cessation does not improve, medical management with
  antiplatelet agents, immunomodulators, vasodilators, anticoagulants
\item
  Endovascular-distal small vessel intervention
\item
  Surgical-upper extremity autogenous vein bypass-limited success due
  to poor outflow
\item
  Sometimes can consider upper extremity sympathectomy, but unproven
  benefit
\item
  Amputation-reported in 30-40\% who are followed longer than 5
  years\citep{olin2018}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What are common characteristics for patients who are suspected to have
a large vessel vasculitis?} \citep{shanmugam137VasculitisOther2019, weyand2003}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Affect aorta and major branches
\item
  Present with non-specific heterogenous symptoms making the diagnosis
  challenging. Most commonly, they present with systemic or
  constitutional symptoms (fatigue, fever, weight loss, arthralgias)
\item
  Frequently, diagnosis made with presence of constitutional symptoms,
  elevated inflammatory markers, and dedicated imaging (MRA, CTA, DUS,
  or PET)

\item
  Young patients \textless20 years and female in 80-90\% of cases, Asian
  populations
\item
  Criteria (ACR)

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Onset \textless40 years
  \item
    Claudication of an extremity
  \item
    Decreased brachial pulse
  \item
    \textgreater10 mmHg SBP between arms
  \item
    Bruit over subclavian arteries or aorta
  \item
    Arteriographic evidence of narrowing/occlusion in aorta/primary
    branches/or large upper/lower extremity arteries
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Initial therapy for acute vasculitis should include steroids and
  close observation. If persistent severe symptoms after acute phase,
  then consider surgical repair. Mid aortic syndrome likely needs open
  repair from uninvolved aorta-usually thoracic aorta-to bifurcation
  bypass with jump graft to involved visceral vessels.\citep{ehlert2019}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{giant-cell-arteritis}{%
\subsubsection{Giant cell arteritis}\label{giant-cell-arteritis}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Aorta and main branches, but predilection for carotid artery
  branches\citep{bongartz2006}
\item
  Diagnosis:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Age at disease onset \textgreater{} 50 years
  \item
    New headache
  \item
    Temporal artery abnormality
  \item
    Elevated ESR (\textgreater50) - can be normal in up to a quarter of cases.
  \item
    Abnormal artery biopsy (gold standard test)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Other symptoms include jaw pain with mastication or visual changes
\item
  Associated with Polymyalgia rheumatic, characterized by morning
  stiffness in shoulders/hips occurring in 40-50\% of patients
\item
  Arteriography/MRA/CTA/PET may be used to assess large vessel
  involvement - classic finding is smooth, tapering stenosis.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{How should patients be monitored with active large artery
vasculitis?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lab data tracked at least monthly for 6 months with close follow-up
  to ensure appropriate response to medical treatment and enable
  physicians to assess for adverse effects of medical treatment
\item
  Repeat tests after remission reached and imaging choice to evaluate
  large vessels (DUS/CTA/MRA)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the medical treatment for GCA and when do you consider
surgical treatment?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Medical-steroid therapy. In as many as 50\% of patients who have a
  large vessel vasculitis refractory to glucocorticoid therapy alone,
  patients will trial immunomodulators or cytotoxic trugs (i.e.
  methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, tocilizumab, or
  leflunomide)
\item
  Intervention-once remission, treatment of symptomatic arterial
  lesions or those at aneurysm size threshold should be considered and
  as many as 50-70\% with large vessel vasculitis will require
  intervention.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Endovascular-angioplasty/stent/stent graft for large vessel
    vasculitis have all been described, however higher restenosis in
    endovascular compared to open treatment
  \item
    Open Surgery (gold standard)-lesions are long, fibrotic and
    therefore less amenable to endovascular treatment. Bypass grafts
    from aorta-CCA are the most common (CEA should be avoid due to
    pathology involved)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Upper extremity bypass with autogenous vein to the brachial
      artery
    \item
      Aortic aneurysms should be managed with open
      surgery\citep{janssen2008}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Proximal-median sternotomy with supraclavicular fossa extension
    for adequate proximal control for right side, however
    supraclavicular with left anterolateral thoracotomy for left
    subclavian aneurysm
  \item
    Mid-Distal-supraclavicular/infraclavicular generally adequate
    for control where again resection of the clavicle may be needed
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Endovascular Repair-transbrachial/transfemoral approach with covered

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Must consider vertebral artery origin. Can cover vertebral
    artery if contralateral vertebral artery is patent and of

\item
  Hybrid Repair-embolization/coils of proximal subclavian artery
  combined with subclavian transposition or carotid-subclavian bypass
\item
  For aberrant subclavian artery aneurysm, resection or exclusion of
  the aneurysmal artery with vascular reconstruction of the subclavian
  artery is recommended. Especially in the setting of dysphagia
  lusoria, subclavian artery reconstructed by interposition graft
  where proximal anastomosis is on ascending aorta. Alternatively,
  left posterolateral thoracotomy for proximal aneurysm resection and
  right supraclavicular incision for reconstruction of subclavian

  Initially can be occlusion/thrombosis or spasm, however later damage
  can cause aneurysmal degeneration
\item

  reconstruction with free flap due to local vascular damage or
  occlusion of major artery requiring bypass grafting
\end{itemize}

Extreme thermal injuries

Critically ill patients can be treated effectively with the use of a
closure device or covered stent placement.\citep{yoon2015, tran2009, cohen2014} Cut down in the mid subclavian artery is very difficult to
perform and results in increased blood loss and worse outcomes.

Trauma to the proximal subclavian should be accessed on R through a
median sternotomy or trapdoor incision. On the left, the proximal
subclavian is accessed best through an anterolateral thoracotomy. For
more on exposures, see \ref{upper-extremity}.

\hypertarget{thoracic-outlet-syndrome}{%
\section{Thoracic Outlet Syndrome}\label{thoracic-outlet-syndrome}}

\textbf{27 Nov 2019:} \emph{Nedal Katib, Prince of Wales, Sydney Australia}

Thoracic Outlet Syndrome = A constellation of signs and symptoms
relating to the compression of the neurovascular structures that occurs
as these structures travel between the thoracic aperture and the upper
limb.

Types: Neurogenic, Venous and Arterial

\begin{itemize}
\item
  vTOS -- 2-3\%
\item
  aTOS -- 1\%
\item
  nTOS -- \textgreater95\% \citep{humphries124ThoracicOutlet2019}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{anatomy-1}{%
\subsection{Anatomy}\label{anatomy-1}}

Understanding the anatomy of what is collectively referred to as the
thoracic outlet is the best way to thoroughly appreciate this topic.

Anatomy from anterior to posterior

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Subclavian vein
\item
  Phrenic nerve
\item
  Anterior scalene muscle attachment to the first rib
\item
  The subclavian artery
\item
  The brachial plexus
\item
  The middle scalene muscle.
\end{itemize}

Three spaces where the neurovascular structures are at risk of
compression:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Interscalene Triangle
\item
  Costoclavicular Passage\citep{garygwindAnatomicExposuresVascular2013}
\item
  Subcoracoid Space\citep{garygwindAnatomicExposuresVascular2013}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Interscalene Triangle:}

Appreciating the attachments of the Anterior and Middle Scalene Muscles
on the first rib becomes important in the diagnosis of the various types
and also the ultimate surgical management of the compression.

\textbf{Anterior Scalene:}

Attachments: Anterior Tubercles of the four `typical' cervical vertebrae
(3-6) AND the scalene tubercle on the upper surface of the first rib.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Phrenic nerve runs along anterior scalene muscle and injury can
  cause ipsilateral diaphragm paralysis.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Middle Scalene:}

Attachments: The posterior tubercles and intertubercular lamellae of all
the cervical vertebrae AND the Quadrangular area between the neck and
subclavian groove of the first rib. \citep{mcminnLastAnatomyRegional2019}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Long thoracic nerve runs along middle scalene muscle and injury can
  cause winged scapula.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The First Rib:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The broadest and flattest of the ribs and is an `Atypical Rib'.
\item
  The upper surface of the first rib has the scalene and quadrangular
  tubercles for attachments of the anterior and middle scalene muscles
  respectively. There are also three grooves for the Subclavian Vein,
  artery and the Lower Trunk of the Brachial Plexus.
\item
  The Inferior Surface is smooth and inferior and medially has an
  attachment for the suprapleural membrane, Sibson's fascia AKA
  scalenus minimus, which is tethered to the C7 vertebrae.
\item
  This is the passage of the subclavian vein largely as it emerges
  through the tight space created by the clavicle, the subclavius
  muscle and the costoclavicular ligament and also more posteriorly
  this can also compress the artery and nerves as the space can also
  be narrow in relation with the scapula and subscapularis.
  \citep{garygwindAnatomicExposuresVascular2013}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Subclavius Muscle:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Attached to the costochondral junction of the first rib and is
  inserted into the subclavian groove on the inferior surface of the
  clavicle. \citep{mcminnLastAnatomyRegional2019}
\item
  This space is best appreciated by intimate knowledge of three
  things:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The Coracoid Process and its attachments
  \item
    The Pectoralis Minor Muscle
  \item
    The Clavipectoral Fascia
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Coracoid Process:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Arising from the Scapula as a `process', this broad-based bony
  landmark offers attachment to muscles and ligaments.
\item
  The relevant attachments being the pectoralis minor muscle occupying
  the medial border for about 2cm behind its tip. The tip itself
  having a medial and lateral facet for the short head of biceps and
  the coracobrachialis muscles respectively.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pectoralis Minor Muscle:}

Attached to the bone of the third, fourth and fifth ribs AND the medial
border of the coracoid process.

\textbf{Clavipectoral Fascia:}

A sheet of fascial membrane that fills the space between the clavicle
and pectoralis minor splitting and encompassing the subclavius muscle.
Its superior portion is what can be thickened and become a tight band
referred to as the costocoracoid ligament.

\textbf{Phrenic Nerve Anomaly:}

The Phrenic Nerve normally runs anterior to the Subclavian Vein. A rare
anomaly is the nerve compressing the vein anteriorly and in very rare
circumstances due to the timing of development can run through the vein
itself.

Anomalous anatomy can also cause TOS especially when patients have a
Cervical Rib and anomalous first ribs or a congenital band attaching to
the first rib.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Incidence of anomalous first ribs and cervical ribs is 0.76\% and
  0.75\% respectively.
\item
  Incidence of bands are as high as 63\% in the general population.
  \citep{humphries124ThoracicOutlet2019}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Scalene Triangle compression -- most common cause of brachial plexus
  and neurogenic TOS
\item
  Cervical Rib and Anomalous First Rib
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cervical Rib and Anomalous First Rib

Provocative maneuvers are largely used for nTOS. While these are
described and mentioned in most texts their utility largely is beyond
the scope of a vascular surgeon's assessment and diagnosis of nTOS.

\textbf{Adson Test}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Extended abducted and externally rotated arm -- palpate radial pulse
\item
  Rotate and laterally flex the neck to the ipsilateral side while
  inhaling deeply.
\item
  A positive test results in reduction or complete obliteration of
  radial pulse
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Roos Test / EAST test}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Patient seated and both arms abducted 90 degrees and externally
  rotated and elbows flexed at 90 degrees.
\item
  Open and close hands for 3 minutes or until pain or paraesthesia
  sets in.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Elveys Test}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Abduct both arms to 90 degrees with elbows extended and dorsiflex
  both wrists.
\item
  If pain is elicited as wrists dorsiflexed then test is positive.
\item
  A further manoeuvre is then performed, laterally flex the head on
  each side, if pain is elicited on the contralateral side to which
  the head is flexed then test is positive.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  As per ACCP Guidelines: Initial management is anticoagulation
  regardless of etiology. \citep{kearonAntithromboticTherapyVTE2016}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The limitations of anticoagulation alone are that the slow
    recanalization of the thrombus may lead to eventual valvular
    damage and intravenous scarring.
    \citep{sekharYearbookVascularEndovascular2018}
  \item
    Thrombolysis has been considered superior to anticoagulation
    alone in minimizing valvular damage due to residual clot.
    \citep{urschelSurgeryRemainsMost2008}
  \item
    Systemic Lysis -- non favored due to risk of intracranial
    hemorrhage. \citep{grunwaldCatheterDirectedThrombolysisTreatment2004}
  \item
    Catheter Directed Lysis (CDT) -- carries a lower risk of

\item
  Surgery for vTOS remains to be mainly Rib Resection and
  decompression of the subclavian vein with or without venolysis and
  patch plasty either surgical or endovenous.
\item
  Surgical treatment of severe resistant subclavian vein stenosis in

  Options post recanalization:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Deferring surgical decompression for 1-3 months after
    thrombolysis to allow for healing of the venous endothelium and
    resolution of the acute inflammatory process.
    \citep{humphries123ThoracicOutlet2019}
  \item
    Decompression during the same admission, as the thrombolysis,
    with the main benefit being to reduce the risk of re-occlusion.
    \citep{humphries123ThoracicOutlet2019, molinaPagetSchroetterSyndromeTreated2007}
  \item
    Post decompression venography and treatment 2 weeks post rib
    resection may help to prevent recurrence and long term vein
    patency. \citep{changRoutineVenographyFollowing2012}

    Scher Staging of aTOS

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Stage 0: Asymptomatic
    \item
      Stage 1: Stenosis of Subclavian Artery with minor post
      stenotic dilatation with no intimal disruption
    \item
      Stage 2: Subclavian artery aneurysm with intimal damage and

    \item
      Stage 3: Distal embolisation from subclavian artery disease
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Supraclavicular rib resection is the most suitable for adequate
  arterial reconstruction. Transaxillary has been argued to offer more
  complete rib resection however arterial repair is not possible in
  this approach.
\item
  Subclavian artery repair is necessary in Scher Stages 2 and 3 and in
  some cases 1. Arterial repair with conduit either GSV, Femoral Vein
  or prosthetic have been described. Ringed PTFE offers good patency
  and resistance to kinking in this functional anatomical location.

\hypertarget{management-13}{%
\subsubsection{Management}\label{management-13}}

As the patient has already seen multiple specialists and
physiotherapists, the role of the vascular surgeon with nTOS is often
limited but should focus on:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Exclude other causes
\item
  Confirm diagnosis -- Neurophysiologic Tests (EMG and NCS)
\item
  Seek alternate opinion
\item
  Trial of Physiotherapy and non-operative management - patients
  should be evaluated and undergo a 6 week course of physical therapy.
  This physical therapy focuses on scalene and pectoralis stretching
  improving mobility of the shoulder and strengthening the arm. Many
  improve with physical therapy.
  \citep{baldermanPhysicalTherapyManagement2019}
\item
  Anterior scalene lidocaine block may provide temporary symptom
  relief (\textasciitilde7 days) and may help identify those patients most likely
  to benefit from surgical decompression.
  \citep{salhanPC214UltrasoundGuidedAnesthetic2016, lumImpactAnteriorScalene2012}
\item
  Botulinum injection may give an average of 6 weeks of relief.
  \citep{salhanPC214UltrasoundGuidedAnesthetic2016}
\item
  Be selective in patients who may require surgery
\end{itemize}

Surgery with Rib resection often is accomplished with transaxillary or
supraclavicular approach, particularly if scalenectomy or cervical rib

\textbf{What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)?}
\citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Defined as a localized dilation of an artery to a diameter greater
  than 50\% (1.5x) of its normal diameter. It is generally accepted
  that \textgreater3cm in adults is considered aneurysmal for the abdominal
  aorta.
\item
  AAAs can be described as:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Infrarenal -- distal to the renal arteries with normal aorta
    between the renal arteries and the aneurysm origin.
  \item
    Juxtarenal -- aneurysm extends to the renal arteries but does
    not involve them
  \item
    Pararenal -- aneurysm involving the origin of at least one of
    the renal arteries
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Estimated 1.1 million Americans have AAAs, which equates to a
  prevalence of 1.4\% in 50-84 year old general population.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Men 65-75y with a history of smoking have a prevalence of 6-7\% -
    hence the need for screening.\citep{lefevre2014, chaikof2018}
  \item
    Men without a history of smoking have a prevalence of 2\%.
  \item
    Women who are current smokers 2\%, and women with a history of
    smoking 0.8\%.\citep{wanhainen2006}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  AAAs are 3-7x more prevalent than thoracic aortic aneurysms and can
  co-exist with other aneurysms throughout the arterial vascular
  system like popliteal artery aneurysms.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    In a 10-year review originating from Ireland, 50\% of patients
    that presented with unilateral popliteal artery aneurysms had
    associated AAA. In patients with bilateral popliteal aneurysms,
    63\% of those had associated AAA.
    \citep{duffyPoplitealAneurysms10year1998}
  \item
    Patients with femoral aneurysms have an 85\% chance of an
    associated AAA. \citep{diwanIncidenceFemoralPopliteal2000}
  \item
    Conversely, if a patient is first found to have a AAA, there is
    an 11\% chance of having associated popliteal artery aneurysms
    \textgreater15mm. \citep{tuvesonPatientsAbdominalAortic2016}
  \item
    Another study showed a rate of femoral-popliteal aneurysms in
    AAA patients is approximately 14\%.
    \citep{diwanIncidenceFemoralPopliteal2000}
  \item
    This association stresses the importance of a good physical exam
    when evaluating a patient with a AAA and is commonly tested on
    exams.\citep{chaikof2018, diwan2000}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the pathogenesis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?}
\citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  More than 90\% of AAAs are associated with atherosclerosis.
\item
  Other causes include cystic medial necrosis, dissection, Marfan's
  syndrome, Ehler's-Danlos syndrome, HIV and syphilis.
\item
  Elastin and collagen are the major structural proteins responsible
  for the integrity of the aortic wall and defects in these cause
  degeneration and further aneurysmal change.
\item
  For example, a mutation in fibrillin in Marfan's syndrome causes
  elastin fragmentation and pathological remodeling of the wall of the
  artery to form cystic medial degeneration.
\item
  Several investigations have also shown that upregulations of
  metalloproteinase activity, specifically MMP-2 and MMP-9, have an
  essential role in aneurysm formation. Imbalances between aortic wall
  proteases and antiproteases cause degradation of the extracellular
  matrix and loss of structural integrity of the aortic wall.
\item
  Increased thrombus burden is associated with wall thinning, medial
  loss of smooth muscle cells, elastin degradation, adventitial
  inflammation and aortic wall hypoxia which all increase the rate of
  AAA growth.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Of note, intraluminal thrombus rarely embolizes and is not an
    indication for anticoagulation.\citep{singh2019, cameron2018}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Infective aortitis is a rare but highly morbid cause for aortic
  aneurysm formation. Treatment in this setting should be more
  aggressive with the addition of antibiotic therapy and open surgical
  repair with rifampin soaked graft whenever feasible.\citep{gornik2008, paravastu2009, rasmussen1997}
\item
  For more about aortitis, see \ref{large-vasculitis}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are the risk factors for AAA occurrence and growth?}
\citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Risk factors for AAAs are similar to the risk factors for occlusive
  atherosclerosis and include age, tobacco use, hypertension, male
  gender and hypercholesterolemia.
\item
  It has been found that diabetes is protective for AAA progression
  and rupture.
\item
  Cigarette smoking is the single most important modifiable risk
  factor to prevent occurrence and growth of AAAs. Smoking increases
  the rate of growth by 35\% for abdominal aortic aneurysms.
\item
  Medical therapy has been studied with disappointing results.
  Beta-blockers and ACE/ARB inhibitors have been studied but have not
  shown any effect on growth of AAAs.
\item
  Men more likely to have AAA, but women develop at a later age with
  more aggressive growth and risk for rupture.
  \citep{loAbdominalAorticAneurysms2016}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Stronger association with smoking in women.
  \item
    Women have same outcomes from endo repair, higher complications
    from open repair due to poorly managemend CV risk factors.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Fluoroquinolones\citep{lee2015, lee2018, lemaire2018, pasternak2018}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    In a recent study just published in JAMA Surgery this January,
    the group at UNC showed an increased short-term risk of
    developing an aortic aneurysm with fluoroquinolone use.
    \citep{newtonAssociationFluoroquinoloneUse2021a}
  \item
    They reviewed all prescription fills for fluoroquinolones or
    comparative antibiotics from 2005-2017.
  \item
    This included \textgreater27 million US Adults aged 18-64 years old with
    no history of aneurysms.
  \item
    18\% of the prescriptions were fluoroquinolones.
  \item
    Fluoroquinolones were associated with increased incidence of
    aortic aneurysms. Compared to the other antibiotics,
    fluoroquinolones were associated with a higher 90-day incidence
    of AAA and iliac aneurysms as well as more likely to undergo
    aneurysm repair.
  \item
    They recommended that fluoroquinolone use should be pursued with
    caution in all adults, not just high risk individuals, and they
    recommended broadening of the warnings from the FDA.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Fluoroquinolones playing a role in dissections and aneurysm
  formation is often a highly tested question
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the dreaded complication of AAA?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Aneurysm rupture is the fear with a diagnosis of AAA. The risk of
  rupture increases yearly as the aneurysm expands. Once an aneurysm
  develops, it tends to enlarge gradually yet progressively. This is
  an important concept to grasp for testing.\citep{lindsay2019, tracci}
\item
  Growth rate

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    For smaller aneurysms (3-5cm in size), the growth rate is
    approximately 2-3mm/year
  \item
    For larger aneurysms (\textgreater5cm), the growth rate is higher at
    3-5mm/year.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Rupture risk, historically, has been described as:
\end{itemize}

    A systematic review from the UK published in JVS in 2015, the
    rupture risks were far lower than previously reported and what

    reviewing 1514 patients, published between 1995 and
    2014.\citep{parkinsonRuptureRatesUntreated2015}

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evaluation-and-diagnosis}{%
\section{Evaluation and Diagnosis}\label{evaluation-and-diagnosis}}

\textbf{What is the work up for a AAA?}
\citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  75\% of all infrarenal AAAs are asymptomatic when first detected and
  often incidentally discovered on unrelated imaging.
\item
  Symptoms - Some patients may report symptoms such as abdominal,
  flank or back pain from pressure on adjacent somatic sensory nerves
  or overlying peritoneum. Tenderness by itself is not a reliable
  indicator of impending rupture. Other symptoms include thrombosis
  and distal embolization.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{imaging}{%
\subsection{Imaging}\label{imaging}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ultrasound, when feasible, is the preferred imaging modality for
  aneurysm screening and surveillance.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) recommends a one-time
    ultrasound screening in men and women ages 65 to 75 years with
    either a history of smoking or a family history of AAA, as well
    as men and women over the age of 75 with a smoking history in
    otherwise good health who have not previously undergone
    screening. \citep{chaikofSocietyVascularSurgery2018a}
  \item
    For more technical details on duplex screening see \ref{aorta}.

\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  It is important to note that these screening guidelines are Level 2,
  Grade C evidence from the SVS.
\item
  Traditionally, once duplex reveals an aneurysm 5cm in size, an
  initial CTA is performed and patients are followed with additional
  CT scans to assist with operative planning.
\item
  CT Angiograms are helpful in operative planning and determining
  candidacy for EVAR. You can assess the relationship of the aneurysm
  to the renal arteries, assess the access vessels, and measure seal
  zones

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The maximum aneurysm diameter derived from the CTA should be
    based on outer wall to outer wall measurement perpendicular to
    the path of the aorta (the centerline of the aneurysm).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  MRA is recommended for patients with renal insufficiency who cannot
  tolerate iodinated contrast.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{management-15}{%
\section{Management}\label{management-15}}

\textbf{What are the indications for repair?}
\citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The current recommendation to repair a fusiform aneurysm is 5.5cm
  for men (Level 1, Grade A evidence), 5.0cm for women as they have a
  higher risk for rupture, and rapid growth (\textgreater5mm over 6 months).
  \citep{chaikofSocietyVascularSurgery2018a}
\item
  For saccular aneurysms, the SVS practice guidelines recommend
  elective repair (Level 2, Grade C evidence).
  \citep{chaikofSocietyVascularSurgery2018a}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Studies show equivalent wall stress in saccular aneurysms at
    much smaller sizes when compared to fusiform aneurysms. This has
    led to the notion that they have a higher rupture risk at
    smaller sizes.
  \item
    A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery in 2016 showed a
    significant portion of ruptures \textless55mm in size were saccular in
    nature. \citep{kristmundssonMorphologySmallAbdominal2016}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Specific size guidelines for repair are currently lacking
      because of their infrequent presentation.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are the options for repair, and how do you choose?}
\citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019, fairman72AortoiliacAneurysms2019}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Two options: open repair and endovascular aortic aneurysm repair
  (EVAR).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When attempting to decide between the two, one must consider the
    patient's perioperative risk as well as the patient's anatomy,
    which will be reviewed further here.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  When reviewing the patient's risk for surgery, there are many tools
  to assist, which are outlined in the Society for Vascular Surgery's
  practice guidelines.
\item
  The VSGNE or Vascular Study Group of New England developed a risk
  prediction model for mortality which can assist in your decision
  making. This is endorsed by both SVS and the Vascular Quality
  Initiative.\citep{chaikof2018, eslami2015}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    This risk model looks at open vs endovascular repair and further
    delineates infrarenal vs suprarenal clamps
  \item
    It includes aneurysm sizes with 6.5cm as the cut off.
  \item
    It includes age above or below 75yo.
  \item
    Gender and comorbidities are included like heart disease,
    cerebrovascular disease and COPD.
  \item
    An important risk factor is also renal function which is
    delineated by creatinine at 1.5-2 or \textgreater2.
  \item
    Each of these risk factors is assigned a point grading.
  \item
    These points are added together and they place the patient on a
    spectrum of mortality risk. Depending on the amount of points
    accumulated, the risk is divided into low, medium, high or
    prohibitively high-risk groups
  \item
    This is something that can help both the patient and physician
    in deciding on surgery and how to proceed.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Recent studies have shown that decreased aerobic fitness and high
  frailty score predicted increased morbidity and mortality after open
  aneurysm repair.
\item
  High-risk patients are defined by the following in the SVS
  guidelines:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Unstable angina or angina at rest
  \item
    Congestive heart failure with EF \textless{} 25-30\%

    elevated PCO2, or both.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  To help delineate a patient's risk, a preoperative workup is
  necessary. The SVS practice guidelines recommend the following:
  \citep{chaikofSocietyVascularSurgery2018a}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Determine if the patient has an active cardiovascular condition.
    Coronary artery disease is responsible for at least 50\% to 60\%
    of perioperative and late deaths after operations on the
    abdominal aorta, therefore, it is important for patients to
    undergo cardiac evaluation prior to surgery.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, severe
      valvular disease, significant arrythmia -\textgreater{} Cardiology
      consultation (Level 1, Grade B)
    \item
      Significant clinical risk factors such as coronary artery
      disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, diabetes
      mellitus, and chronic kidney disease -\textgreater{} Stress test (Level
      2, Grade B)
    \item
      Worsening dyspnea -\textgreater{} Echocardiogram (Level 1, Grade A)
    \item
      All patients undergoing EVAR or open repair require EKG
    \item
      In patients capable of moderate physical activities, such as
      climbing two flights of stairs or running a short distance
      (MET \textgreater= 4), there is no benefit in further testing.
    \item
      If coronary intervention is required, this takes precedence
      over aneurysm repair.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    History of COPD

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Pulmonary function test with ABG (Level 2, Grade C)
    \item
      Smoking cessation for at least 2 weeks prior (Level 1, Grade

      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      Pulmonary bronchodilators at least 2 weeks before aneurysm
      repair (Level 2, Grade C)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In patients who are deemed high risk, EVAR is the most attractive
  option in anatomically suitable patients
\item
  Morbidity and mortality rates are lower for EVAR than open repair in
  the short term. This is illustrated in multiple studies.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The EVAR-1 trial, a randomized prospective UK study including
    1082 patients, compared EVAR with open AAA repair in patients
    who were fit enough to undergo open surgical repair from
    1999-2003. The 30-day mortality rate was reduced in the EVAR
    group (1.7\% vs 4.7\%), although secondary interventions were more
    common in the EVAR group (9.8\% vs.~5.8\%).
    \citep{greenhalghComparisonEndovascularAneurysm2004}
  \item
    The DREAM trial, a multicenter randomized trial from 2000-2003,
    compared open repair with EVAR in 345 patients with a reduction
    in operative mortality (4.7\% vs 9.8\%) with the majority of
    complications accounted for by pulmonary issues.
    \citep{prinssenRandomizedTrialComparing2004}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  This early survival benefit with EVAR over open repair disappears by
  the third postoperative year.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The Open vs Endovascular Repair (OVER) trial included 881
    patients from 42 VA centers randomized to either EVAR or open
    repair. This demonstrated that perioperative mortality was
    improved in the EVAR group (0.5\% vs 3.0\%), yet no statistically
    significant difference was seen in mortality at 2 years (7.0\% vs
    9.8\%). \citep{lederleOpenEndovascularRepair2019}
  \item
    Late mortality seems to be higher in EVAR due to ruptures from
    endoleaks that do not occur in open repair.
    \citep{rajendranLateRuptureAbdominal2017}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Reviewing the anatomic criteria for traditional EVAR may rule out
  EVAR as an option in some patients. These criteria vary slightly
  depending on the particular device being used.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Neck

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      A neck length of at least 10-15mm from the renal arteries to
      the aneurysm start with a diameter of 18-32mm.
    \item
      It is important that the neck is relatively free of thrombus
      or calcification to decrease the risk of endoleaks.
    \item
      Infrarenal necks 4-15mm would require fenestrated
      endovascular repair. The only FDA approved device for
      fenestrated repairs is the Cook Z-Fen
      device.\citep{oderichResultsUnitedStates2014}

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Z-fen requires diameter 19-31mm, angle \textless45deg angle to
        long axis of aneurysm, ipsilateral iliac fixation \textgreater30mm
        and 9-21mm in diam, contralateral iliac \textgreater30mm and
        7-21mm diam. Multiple or early branching renal arteries
        can limit this reapir as well.
        \citep{oderichTechnicalAspectsRepair2014}
      \item
        Parallel grafts for short necks (i.e.~snorkel or
        chimney) require 20mm seal for good outcomes.
        \citep{donasCollectedWorldExperience2015}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Angulation

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Neck angulation should be \textless{} 60 degrees for current devices
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Access vessels

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Access vessels must be adequate for delivery of the device
      depending on the sheath size required (6-8mm)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Aortic bifurcation

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The aortic bifurcation must be \textgreater20mm in size to accommodate
      the graft opening to full caliber
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Iliac landing zone

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Adequate seal zone in the distal common iliac arteries of
      10-15mm in length and diameter of 7.5-25mm.
    \item
      If covering the hypogastric arteries is necessary
      unilaterally to obtain a seal, you can embolize the
      hypogastric artery (to prevent retrograde flow) and extend
      the graft into the external iliac artery.
    \item
      If this is an issue bilaterally, an iliac branch device can
      assist in maintaining perfusion into the hypogastric
      arteries.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Special considerations

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Aortocaval fistula - sometimes aneurysms can be complicated by
  fistula with the IVC. This can occur with primary fistula, rupture
  and after repair. This is rare, 1\% in elective AAA and 6\% in
  rupture.\citep{brightwell2013, schmidt1994} High risk of persistent
  endoleak due to ongoing flow into IVC. Open repair often
  best.\citep{orion2016}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evar}{%
\subsection{EVAR}\label{evar}}

\textbf{Can you briefly go over the steps of an EVAR?}
\citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  EVAR now accounts for approximately 70-80\% of elective abdominal
  aortic aneurysm repairs and 65\% of iliac aneurysm repairs in the
  United States and many other countries.
\item
  Performed in the operating room or IR suite with a fixed or portable
  C-arm
\item
  Anesthesia

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Regional block, local anesthesia or general anesthesia depending
    on surgeon preference and patient risk
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Groin access and short sheath placement

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Percutaneous - Closure devices are introduced prior to inserting
    the large sheaths containing the stent-grafts
  \item
    Cut-down
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Pigtail catheter is used to perform an aortogram of the abdominal
  aorta and iliac arteries
\item
  The renal artery orifices are marked. If there is any concern about
  good visualization, IVUS (intravascular ultrasound) can be used to
  assist.
\item
  Systemic heparin is given
\item
  Bilateral femoral sheaths are exchanged over a stiff wire for the
  necessary sheaths required for the device size chosen.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Main trunk and ipsilateral limb sheath on one side
  \item
    Contralateral limb sheath on the other side
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The main body is positioned in the proximal neck and a repeat
  angiogram is commonly performed to confirm the positioning of the
  device at the desired level just below the lowest renal artery. It
  is best to position the main body so that the gate is directed at
  the simplest angle to cannulate.
\item
  The main body is deployed to the point where the gate is opened
\item
  Contralateral limb gate cannulation is performed using a wire and
  directional catheter.
\item
  Once in the gate, a pigtail catheter is formed within the main body
  and must be able to spin freely 360 degrees to confirm placement
  within the endograft
\item
  The contralateral limb is introduced and deployed taking care to
  preserve flow to the internal iliac artery.
\item
  The remainder of the main body is deployed and iliac extensions
  deployed if required.
\item
  The stent graft is ballooned at the neck, within the gate, at the
  bifurcation, and distal iliac seal zones.
\item
  An aortogram, usually multiple in different views, is performed to
  exclude any endoleaks.
\item
  The sheaths are removed, and the groin sites are closed using
  Perclose devices if performed percutaneously, or primary repair if
  open cutdown performed.
\item
  Check pedal signals at the end of the case to ensure no
  thromboembolic events or femoral artery access injuries have
  occurred. If there is concern, an ultrasound duplex can be performed
  intraoperatively.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{You mentioned endoleaks, can you discuss the complications specific to
EVAR and the management?} \citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  15 year follow up from EVAR-1 shows inferior late survival and
  higher re-intervention in EVAR patients when compared with open
  repair. \citep{patelEndovascularOpenRepair2016}
\item
  Many of the cardiopulmonary complications inherent with open repair
  do not occur with EVAR as there is no aortic cross clamping.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In a study from Mayo clinic evaluating elective infrarenal AAA
    repairs from 1999 to 2001, Elkouri et al found that cardiac and
    pulmonary morbidity after EVAR was drastically reduced compared
    to open repair (11\% vs 22\% and 3\% vs 16\%, respectively).
    \citep{elkouriPerioperativeComplicationsEarly2004}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Risk of ischemic colitis remains as the IMA is covered with EVAR. It
  is lower than with open repair but remains 1-2\%.
\item
  Renal insufficiency may occur secondary to contrast administration
  in a patient with underlying chronic kidney disease. Thromboembolic
  events may occur from thrombus-laden aortic necks with wire and
  device manipulation to the renal arteries as well.
\item
  Iliac limb occlusion - can occur within hours of EVAR (3-5\%). Risk
  factors included iliac artery tortuosity, calcified plaque burden or
  occlusive disease, external iliac artery dissection\citep{vacirca2019},
  inadequate outflow due to access site complication. Post operative
  CFA duplex will show dampened waveforms.\citep{greenhalgh2010, taudorf2014}
\item
  Emergent conversion from EVAR to open are associated with
  significant increase in morbidity and mortality. Risk factors
  include aneurysm diameter, young age, female gender and nonwhite
  race.\citep{ultee2016}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{endoleaks}{%
\subsubsection{Endoleaks}\label{endoleaks}}

Defined as persistent blood flow within the aneurysm sac following EVAR.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Type I

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A leak at the graft ends secondary to inadequate seal proximally
    (1a) or distally (1b)
  \item
    If identified intraoperatively, Type I endoleaks require
    attention with further balloon angioplasty, proximal or distal
    extension, or endoanchors.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Use of endoanchors in thrombus and calcium-laden aorta is
      not recommended.\citep{jordan2014} Outcomes are similar with or
      without suprarenal fixation.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    If seen in follow up surveillance, intervention is necessary.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Type II

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Sac filling secondary to retrograde filling via a branch vessel
    off of the aneurysm sac such as a lumbar artery or the IMA
  \item
    If identified intraoperatively, this typically does not need to
    be addressed in the OR. Typically, type II endoleaks
    spontaneously thrombose and therefore can be observed.
  \item
    It is common to continue monitoring even if there is persistent
    flow as long as there is no aneurysm sac growth. Type II
    endoleaks persist in 5-25\% of patients. Risk factors for
    persistent endoleak include anticoagulation\citep{bobadilla2010},
    patency/number/diameter of IMA/lumbar arteries\citep{ward2014},
    hypogastric coil embolization, distal graft extension, absence
    of COPD, age \textgreater80yrs, and graft type. Risk of rupture is
    1.5-3\%.\citep{lo2016, abularrage2010, timaran2004, shalaby2016, sarac2012, jones2007}
  \item
    If the leak persists for \textgreater{} 6 months with sac enlargement \textgreater5mm,
    intervention is recommended. Several techniques exist to
    eliminate type II endoleaks, most frequently embolization. After
    multiple attempts at repair and if continued sac growth with
    impending Type I leak, then consider open
    conversion.\citep{kelso2009, mohapatra2019}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Type III

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Separation of graft components
  \item
    Usually identified in follow-up surveillance and necessitates
    intervention.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Type IV

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Secondary to a porous graft which typically does not occur any
    longer as endograft material and devices have improved. If seen,
    no intervention is needed at the time, and they usually
    thrombose on their own.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Type V

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Increasing aneurysm sac size with no identifiable endoleak.
    Commonly referred to as endotension.
  \item
    Usually necessitates graft explantation and open repair or
    re-lining of the graft.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{open-repair}{%
\subsection{Open Repair}\label{open-repair}}

\textbf{Now we can move onto open repair. Describe an open infrarenal aneurysm
repair.} \citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019, garygwindAnatomicExposuresVascular2013}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  After thorough preoperative evaluation and clearance, the patient is
  taken back to the operating room. An epidural may be placed
  preoperatively depending on institutional preference. The patient is
  intubated, and arterial and central venous catheters are placed. The
  abdomen is prepped from chest to bilateral thighs.
\item
  A cell-saver should be available to optimize resuscitation during
  the procedure due to expected large amounts of blood loss. Balanced
  resuscitation to prevent coagulopathy is important with significant
  blood loss.
\item
  Exposure

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Trans-peritoneal or retro-peritoneal. First we will describe the
    most common approach: trans-peritoneal.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Surgical steps

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \item
    Mid-line laparotomy, transverse or chevron-style incision
  \item
    A retractor system such as an Omni, Bookwalter or Balfour
    retractor is used to assist in exposure depending on physician
    preference.
  \item
    The transverse colon is retracted cephalad, and the small bowel
    is retracted to the patient's right to expose the aorta. The
    duodenum is mobilized and the ligament of Treitz is divided. The
    posterior peritoneum is opened along the anterior wall of the
    aorta.
  \item
    The aneurysm sac is now in view and careful dissection
    proximally for clamp site is achieved. Identification of the
    left renal vein crossing the aorta is key and can be divided if
    necessary.
  \item
    Identification of the renal arteries proximally is required if
    there is a plan for suprarenal clamping.
  \item
    Isolate bilateral common iliac arteries for distal clamp site.
    Use caution when dissecting the fibro-areolar tissue overlying
    the left common iliac artery as it contains nerves that control
    sexual function. Damage can result in retrograde ejaculation.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      You can avoid nerve injury with mobilization of the sigmoid
      colon medially and identifying the iliac bifurcation
      distally, thus avoiding transecting the tissue overlying the
      left common iliac artery.
    \item
      If the iliac arteries are severely calcified and pose risk
      for injury with clamping, intraluminal balloon catheters can
      be inserted for distal control instead.
    \item
      Also, you must be cognizant of the location of the ureters
      crossing over the iliac bifurcation to prevent injury.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    After proximal and distal clamp sites have been identified,
    systemic heparin is administered by anesthesia.
  \item
    Clamp the distal vessels first to prevent distal embolization.
  \item
    Open the aneurysm sac in a longitudinal fashion toward the
    patient's right to avoid the IMA and clear the sac of thrombus.
    Extend proximally to normal aorta and then t off the incision on
    the aortic wall.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Some physicians prefer to transect the aortic wall as
      opposed to leaving the posterior wall intact for the
      anastomosis.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Lumbar arteries on the posterior wall are ligated using
    figure-of-eight sutures.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Back-bleeding lumbar vessels can be the source of
      significant blood loss.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Graft

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      A tube graft or bifurcated graft depending on the patient's
      anatomy and aortic diameter is chosen. Dacron or PTFE grafts
      are most common, and the choice depends on physician
      preference. This is anastomosed proximally in a continuous
      fashion.
    \item
      Once complete, the graft is flushed forward to flush out any
      thrombus. The graft is then clamped and the aortic clamp
      removed to test the anastomosis. Repair if needed.
    \item
      The distal anastomosis is completed to the aorta or
      bilateral iliac arteries depending on extent of the
      aneurysm.
    \item
      The graft is flushed forward prior to completion to remove
      any thrombus within the graft. The anastomosis is completed
      and clamps removed.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Hypotension may occur at this point from re-perfusion of the
    lower extremities and pelvis. Anesthesia should be notified that
    unclamping will occur soon prior to completion of the distal
    anastomosis to allow for fluid resuscitation in preparation.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The graft can be slowly unclamped or partially clamped to
      assist with blood pressure management during this time. You
      can also place manual pressure on the iliac arteries or
      femoral arteries to slowly release flow and avoid
      significant hypotension.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Next, the IMA must be addressed. The IMA orifice is identified
    within the aneurysm sac.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Chronically occluded or pulsatile back bleeding -\textgreater{} ligate.
    \item
      Anything between occlusion and strong pulsatile back
      bleeding requires further evaluation. This should be
      performed at the end of the case after the internal iliacs
      have been reperfused. Methods to measure perfusion:

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Place vessel loops or micro bulldog on IMA and assess
        the sigmoid colon. If there is a poor doppler signal on
        the antimesenteric border of the sigmoid colon, the IMA
        should be reimplanted.
      \item
        Insert blunt-tip needle through the IMA orifice and pull
        vessel loop around needle to secure and connect to a
        transducer. Pressure less than 35 mmHg requires
        reimplantation. \citep{hoballahInferiorMesentericArtery2021}
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      The Carrel patch technique involves excising a circular
      button of the aortic wall around the IMA and anastomosing it
      to the graft wall.
    \item
      Newer studies have shown that IMA reimplantation does not
      eliminate the risk of ischemic colitis after open AAA
      repair. In a study out of George Washington University in DC
      published in JVS in 2019, there was still significant risk
      of ischemic colitis rates with IMA reimplantation.
      \citep{leeInferiorMesentericArtery2019}

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Using NSQIP data collected prospectively and studied
        retrospectively
      \item
        Out of 2397 patients undergoing AAA from 2012-2015, 135
        patients (5.6\%) had ischemic colitis.
      \item
        672 patients were evaluated further after exclusion
        criteria applied (suprarenal clamp, emergent or
        ruptured, occluded mesenteric vessels)
      \item
        Of these, 637 patients had IMA ligation, 35 had IMA
        reimplantation
      \item
        Reimplantation was associated with - More frequent
        return to the OR (20\% vs 7.2\%), Higher rates of wound
        complications (17.1\% vs 3\%), Higher rates of ischemic
        colitis (8.6\% vs 2.4\%)
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      Difficult to interpret impact of revascularization of IMA on
      ischemic colitis rates, due to selection bias, but should be
      noted that patients who require revascularization still may
      experience colon ischemia.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    To finish, the aneurysm sac is then closed over the graft to
    protect the viscera, and the retro-peritoneum is reapproximated.
    Occasionally, a vascularized omental pedicle flap may be used to
    separate the graft from the duodenum to prevent an aorto-enteric
    fistula if the peritoneum cannot be closed securely.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Steps for the retro-peritoneal approach:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Positioned semi-lateral with the left side up with bilateral
    groins exposed for femoral artery access. This is done in a lazy
    lateral position where the patients upper body is near complete
    lateral but the hips are rotated to the patient's left in
    attempt to keep both groins in the field in case they need to be
    accessed.
  \item
    An oblique incision extends from the left 11th intercostal space
    or tip of the 12th rib to the edge of the rectus abdominus
    muscle, through the external and internal oblique muscles,
    transversalis fascia until you are just superficial to the
    peritoneum. Using blunt finger dissection, the peritoneum is
    dissected from the abdominal wall posteriorly over the psoas
    muscle until the aorta is reached.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Benefits include less postoperative ileus, less
      intraoperative hypothermia, lower IV fluid requirements, and
      less post-op respiratory compromise.
    \item
      A disadvantage is the difficulty addressing the right iliac
      artery from this approach.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{complications}{%
\subsubsection{Complications}\label{complications}}

\textbf{What are some of the complications with open aortic aneurysm repair?}
\citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recent studies have demonstrated equivalent outcomes in younger
  healthy patients undergoing endovascular and open repair.
  \citep{liangComparablePerioperativeMortality2018}
\item
  Myocardial dysfunction which is usually secondary to cardiac
  ischemia or hemorrhage.
\item
  Abdominal compartment syndrome secondary to coagulopathic bleeding
  postoperatively or third spacing of fluids can cause abdominal
  compartment syndrome requiring emergent laparotomy.\citep{cheatham2007, mehta2005, rasmussen1997}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Signs include unexplained oliguria, difficulty maintaining
    adequate ventilation--elevated peak inspiratory pressure, and
    hypotension with significant abdominal distension is concerning
    for abdominal compartment syndrome. A sustained bladder pressure
    \textgreater{} 25 mmHg with associated organ dysfunction (elevated peak
    airway pressures, new onset acute renal failure) is indicative
    of abdominal compartment syndrome.
  \item
    Abdominal compartment syndrome can still occur after EVAR during
    an aortic rupture in up to 10-20\% of patients, therefore, one
    must keep a heightened suspicion for this in the post-operative
    period.\citep{veith2009}
  \item
    It is important to note that a patient with a soft abdominal
    exam can still have abdominal compartment syndrome particularly
    with an enlarged body habitus.
  \item
    Laparotomy may initially worsen hypotension and hemodynamic
    instability due to reperfusion injury.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Renal failure can occur due to suprarenal aortic clamping,
  atheromatous embolization or hypotension causing acute tubular
  necrosis (ATN).
\item
  Postoperative ileus is common. Duodenal obstruction from dissection
  of the ligament of Treitz can mimic a gastric outlet obstruction.
\item
  Ischemic colitis of the left colon and rectum is the most serious
  gastrointestinal complication.\citep{moghadamyeghaneh2016}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Incidence ranges from 0.2 - 10\%, 3-4x more common after
    operations for occlusive disease than aneurysmal disease.
  \item
    It is important to study the collateral pathways on the
    preoperative CT scan and the patient's history to assist in
    surgical decisions regarding IMA reimplantation including:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Stenosis/occlusion of the SMA
    \item
      Previous colectomy
    \item
      IMA or Hypogastric artery occlusion
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Earliest manifestation is postoperative diarrhea, especially
    bloody diarrhea.
  \item
    Sigmoidoscopy is needed for diagnosis.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Mild colon ischemia with patchy mucosal involvement should
      be treated with bowel rest, fluid resuscitation and
      antibiotics. Transmural necrosis requires emergent operation
      with colon resection. Patients can be left in discontinuity
      or an end colostomy performed depending on stability.
    \item
      The mortality rate with colon ischemia after aneurysm
      surgery is about 25\% but reaches over 50\% if bowel resection
      is required.\citep{brewsterIntestinalIschemiaComplicating1991}
      This is a very heavily tested topic for both general surgery
      and vascular surgery boards.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Distal ischemia from embolization downstream can lodge in larger
  vessels or cause microembolization, colloquially known as ``trash
  foot''.
\item
  Infection is rare but can be associated with graft-enteric fistula
  which is another highly tested topic.\citep{fatima2013, oderich2011, smeds2016}

\subsubsection{Postoperative Surveillance}\label{postoperative-surveillance}}

\textbf{What is the post-operative surveillance required for open and
endovascular approach, and how do they differ?}
\citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  That is a great question because it highlights why open repair has
  continued to be so important, especially for young, healthy
  patients.
\item
  Post-operative surveillance is necessary in the immediate
  post-operative period for open repair to evaluate incisions.
  Follow-up is only needed every 5-10 years, unless the patient
  becomes symptomatic.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Peri-anastomotic degeneration occurs in 0.5-10\% of cases. Can be
    diagnosed with CT scan or ultrasound.@curl1992
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In contrast, EVAR patients require a strict postoperative
  surveillance regimen to allow for detection of endoleaks, aneurysm
  sac expansion, stent fracture, limb kinking and material fatigue.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    CT scans at 1-, 6- and 12-month intervals initially then
    annually are recommended which raises concerns related to cost,
    cumulative radiation exposure, and contrast administration.
  \item
    Some physicians may elect to use ultrasound for surveillance
    with CTA prompted if an endoleak is identified or the sac is
    enlarged, particularly in patients with stable aneurysms.
  \item
    The long-term follow-up is often inconsistent and a study of
    19,962 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing EVAR from 2001 to 2008
    showed that 50\% of patients were lost to annual imaging
    follow-up at 5 years after
    surgery.\citep{schanzerFollowUpComplianceEndovascular2015}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Some patients will elect for open repair to avoid frequent
  surveillance if they are a candidate for both, while other patients
  will select endovascular management to avoid the short-term effects
  like longer hospitalizations, post-operative pain, and longer
  recovery time to baseline functioning in open surgery.

\subsection{Ruptured Aneurysms}\label{ruptured-aneurysms}}

\textbf{Although elective repair is important, can you touch on the management
of a ruptured AAA (RAAA) as our last topic of the session?}
\citep{mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019, lindsayChapter74Ruptured2019}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ruptured AAAs have declined secondary to improved medical
  management, decreased rates of smoking and superior diagnostic
  imaging and surveillance.
\item
  Traditionally, it has been taught that 50\% of ruptured AAAs die in
  the field and of those remaining, 50\% will die in the hospital. With
  time, the in-hospital mortality rate has decreased.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In one study out of Finland, of 712 patients with ruptured AAAs
    from 2003-2013, 52\% died prior to arrival to the hospital. Of
    those that were offered surgery, 67\% of patients were alive at
    30 days indicating a mortality rate of 33\%.
    \citep{lainePopulationbasedStudyRuptured2016}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Diagnostic triad on presentation:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Pain, syncope and known or palpable AAA.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  When a ruptured AAA is suspected or diagnosed, permissive
  hypotension is key in the initial management before surgery.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Allowing systolic arterial pressures of 50-70 mmHg as long as
    the patient is mentating appropriately.
  \item
    Limits internal bleeding which further limits loss of platelets
    and clotting factors.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Initial management involves many considerations like patient
  stability, patient's anatomy and the surgeon's experience with
  either open or endovascular repair.
\item
  Due to the developments of endovascular techniques, it is ideal to
  have a CTA prior to the operating room to determine if the patient
  is a candidate for an EVAR.
\item
  There are two options for expedient aortic control in an unstable
  patient with a ruptured aneurysm.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Open supraceliac aortic clamping

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Achieved by retracting the stomach caudally, entering and
      dividing a portion of the gastrohepatic ligament, reaching
      under and medial to the caudate lobe, dividing the pars
      flaccida, and identifying the spine. The aorta lies to the
      patient's left of the spine and is bluntly dissected
      anteriorly and laterally for aortic clamp placement.
    \item
      Another method of supraceliac exposure and control is to
      mobilize and reflect the left lobe of the liver, sweep the
      esophagus to the patient's left, divide the right crus of
      the diaphragm and bluntly dissect both sides of the aorta
      then apply the clamp.
    \item
      A nasogastric tube can help identify the esophagus when
      placing this clamp to ensure the esophagus has been swept to
      the patient's left and protected.
    \item
      The clamp should be moved down to the desired position for
      repair (supra or infrarenal depending on anatomy of the
      aneurysm neck) to decrease ischemia time to visceral vessels
      as soon as possible.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Percutaneous occlusive aortic balloon

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Gain percutaneous access and place an occlusive aortic
      balloon for stabilization in the distal thoracic aorta. This
      will require a long support sheath, usually 12fr in size, to
      prevent distal migration of the occlusive balloon.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  EVAR has been used increasingly to treat ruptured AAAs and offers
  many theoretical advantages over open repair.
\item
  Less invasive, eliminates risk of damage to periaortic and abdominal
  structures, decreases bleeding from surgical dissection, minimizes
  hypothermia and third space losses, and lessens the requirement for
  deep anesthesia.
\item
  EVAR has been deemed superior to open repair for the treatment of
  RAAA in many studies.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    In a study out of UVA published in JVS in August 2020, they
    looked at ruptures in the VQI database from 2003-2018. This
    resulted in 724 pairs of open and endovascular pairs after
    propensity matching. \citep{wangEndovascularRepairRuptured2020a}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There was a clear advantage of endovascular compared to open
      repair in patient's with suitable anatomy.
    \item
      Length of stay was decreased with 5 vs 10 days in open. 30
      day mortality was much lower at 18\% vs 32\%. Major adverse
      events like MI, Renal failure, leg ischemia, mesenteric
      ischemia, respiratory complications were much lower in the
      EVAR group at 35\% vs 68\% in the open group.
    \item
      All cause 1 year survival was much higher with EVAR at 73\%
      vs 59\% in the open group.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Despite improved RAAA results with EVAR, conversion from EVAR to
  open AAA repair appears to have the most unfavorable outcomes in
  terms of mortality.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Conversions can be early or late and are due to access-related
    problems, errors in endograft deployment, graft migration,
    persistent endoleak, graft thrombosis, or infection.
  \item
    In a study evaluating 32,164 patients from NSQIP with 300
    conversions (7,188 standard open repairs and 24,676 EVARs),
    conversion to open repair was associated with a significantly
    higher 30-day mortality than standard open repair (10\% vs 4.2\%)
    and EVAR (10\% vs 1.7\%). In addition, conversion patients
    compared to standard open patients were more likely to undergo
    new dialysis (6.0\% vs.~3.5\%), cardiopulmonary resuscitation
    (5.3\% vs.~1.9\%), postoperative blood transfusion (42.3\% vs.
    31.6\%), and have a myocardial infarction (5.0\% vs.~2.2\%).
    \citep{ulteeConversionEVAROpen2016}
  \item
    A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis found the
    elective late open conversion has comparable outcomes to primary
    open aneurysm repair. 36\% are able to complete with infrarenal
    clamp alone. Highest complication rate in urgent setting (10x
    higher mortality).

  \item
    If open repair involves aneurysm or occlusive disease of

    least one IIA via a jump graft.\citep{krupski1998, huang2008}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Iliac branched device to preserve hypogastric. Minimum size

  \item
    IIA 6.5-13.5mm in diameter, 10mm seal zone\citep{schneider2017}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Extension of EVAR into external iliac and coil of internal iliac
  artery

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If internal iliac arteries also aneurysmal, ensure that outflow
    vessels are all coiled. Posterior branch gives rise to the
    superior gluteal artery, which is high risk for retrograde
    filling.\citep{ryer2012}
  \item
    Coil embolization can result in ipsilateral buttock claudication
    in 12-22\% of patients. Treatment is with medical therapy and
    walking regimen, resolution usually occurs at 6
    months.\citep{papazoglou2012, stokmans2013}
  \item
    If the IMA is chronically occluded, then coverage of the IIA may
    compromise colonic blood flow and increase risk of
    ischemia.\citep{angiletta2011, karch2000}

\textbf{What is Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) and what does it
encompass?}

Peripheral Arterial Disease encompasses extremity arterial disease but
generally is used to describe lower limb arterial occlusive disease.
PAOD is a more specific term and this encompasses atherosclerotic
disease of the lower limb arteries.

The disease has various presentations on a spectrum of asymptomatic
disease to intermittent claudication and finally chronic limb
threatening ischemia (CLTI) formerly known as Critical Limb Ischemia
(CLI) \citep{aboyans2017ESCGuidelines2018}

\textbf{What is the underlying pathophysiology of PAOD?}

The underlying pathophysiology which results in occlusive arterial
disease of the lower limb has somewhat evolved over the last 50 years.
While atherosclerosis remains, the main pathological process resulting
in occlusive disease, smoking related atherosclerosis has in the last 30
years been confounded with the rising incidence of diabetes and in
addition an aging population with progressive arterial disease.

Atherosclerosis, in summary, begins with an injury to the intimal lining
of the arterial wall, which can result from smoking, hypertension or
advanced age and ultimately a chronic inflammatory reaction resulting in
plaque build up and calcification that may result in progressive
stenosis and occlusion or plaque rupture with acute occlusion.

\textbf{What are the risk factors for atherosclerosis?}

Modifiable:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Smoking}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \textbf{most significant modifiable risk factor} for developing
    peripheral arterial disease
  \item
    Causes Endothelial dysfunction by reducing nitric oxide and
    triggering reactive-oxygen species
    \citep{unitedstatessurgeongeneralHealthConsequencesSmoking2014}
  \item
    Causes a prothrombotic environment by causing an increase in
    thromboxane A2 and decreasing Prostacyclin thus overall
    resulting in an increased prothrombotic environment for
    platelets.
  \item
    Smoking has a stronger association with Intermittent
    claudication than with Coronary Artery Disease!
    \citep{gordonPredispositionAtherosclerosisHead1972}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Diabetes , Metabolic Syndrome and Insulin Resistance}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Diabetes Mellitus, after smoking, is the most significant
    modifiable risk factor for developing peripheral arterial
    disease. Both insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are
    independent risk factors for developing peripheral arterial
    disease.
  \item
    The Odds Risk for developing PAD in patients with DM ranges from
    1.89 to 4.05.
  \item
    An increase in HbA1C by 1\% correlates with a 28\% increase risk
    of developing PAD. \citep{adlerUKPDS59Hyperglycemia2002}

    Hypertension. \citep{kannelUpdateEpidemiologicFeatures1985}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Dyslipidemia}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A strong association has long been identified as a risk factor
    for cardiovascular disease.

    The MESA study showed a higher prevalence of PAD (ABPI \textless0.9) in
    African Americans compared to Whites. 7.2\% versus 3.6\%.
    \citep{bildMultiEthnicStudyAtherosclerosis2002}
  \item
    Cross Sectional analysis 6653 subjects all with ABPI assessment
    revealed a prevalence of PAD (\textless0.9) of 4\%. Non-Hispanic Whites:

\item
  The Framingham Heart Study: The original Cohort from the town of
  Framingham, n=5183 patients followed over time for over 30 years.

\textbf{How does Diabetes confound the clinical picture of PAOD?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Increasing Incidence of Diabetes world-wide.
  \citep{boultonGlobalBurdenDiabetic2005}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    2.8\% in 2000, 4.4\% in 2030
  \item
    25\% of patients with diabetes develop a DFU at some stage in
    their lives
  \item
    Limb Loss every 20 seconds world-wide to Diabetes
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What's the pathophysiology of Diabetes and PAOD}
\citep{armstrong26PathophysiologyPrinciplesManagement2012}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sensory Neuropathy, Motor Neuropathy and Autonomic Neuropathy
\item
  Structural and Gait abnormalities
\item
  Arterial disease

  \item
    Large Vessel

  \item
    Both
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Foot infection\citep{bandyk2018, kayssi2019, lepäntalo2011}
\end{itemize}

Given this diverse and confounding pathology the normal progressive
history of PAD is somewhat different. What's most concerning is the
neuropathy resulting in initial presentation being ulceration. This
results in a lack of a `safety net' where presenting with progressive
claudication allows for a period of detection, management and and risk
factor modification before they develop tissue loss and are at risk of
amputation.

Since 2014 and the publication of WIfI a lot has changed in the way we
view PAD leading up to last years new Global Vascular Guidelines on
CLTI, which as a term has replaced CLI.

\hypertarget{intermittent-claudication}{%
\section{Intermittent Claudication}\label{intermittent-claudication}}

\textbf{What is Intermittent Claudication and the classic patient
presentation?}

The original population studies we mentioned determined the epidemiology
and natural history of Intermittent Claudication based on historically
validated and widely accepted questionnaires, namely the Rose
\citep{roseDiagnosisIschaemicHeart1962} (which later was adopted by the WHO)
and subsequently the Edinburgh questionnaire
\citep{lendEdinburghClaudicationQuestionnaire1992}.

All questionnaires are based on a number of key diagnostic clinical
factors that define claudication, they are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Onset
\item
  Calf involvement
\item
  Reproducibility
\item
  Relief with Rest
\item
  Not occurring at Rest
\end{itemize}

The progression historically graded by Fontaine (1954)
\citep{fontaineSurgicalTreatmentPeripheral1954} followed by the Rutherford

Leriche syndrome - Triad of claudication (buttock, thigh, and calf),

\citep{frederick2010, leriche1948, setacci2012}

Differentiating neurogenic claudication from vasculogenic claudication
can be difficult. Vasculogenic claudication is releived by cessation of
ambulation and mostly affects a unilateral calf. Neurogenic improves
with postural changes, more often bilateral and affects the thighs.

\textbf{What is involved in the work up of patients with PAOD/Intermittent
Claudication?}

\hypertarget{history-clinical-examination}{%
\subsection{History / Clinical Examination}\label{history-clinical-examination}}

SVS Guidelines:

``We recommend using ABI as the first-line non-invasive test to establish
a diagnosis of PAD in individuals with symptoms or signs suggestive of
disease. When the ABI is borderline or normal (\textgreater0.9) and symptoms of
claudication are suggestive, we recommend an exercise ABI.''

\emph{Grade 1 Level of Evidence A}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ABPI
\item
  Exercise ABPI
\item
  Ultrasound
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is an ABPI and how is it measured?}

The AHA came out with guidelines on how to perform an ABI and to
standardise the method to allow for more comparable results from
studies.

Divide the higher of the PT or DP pressure by the higher of the right or
left Brachial SBP \emph{(Class 1 Level of Evidence A)}
\citep{aboyansMeasurementInterpretationAnkleBrachial2012}

Sensitivity and Specificity both \textgreater95\% (when ABPI cut off \textless/=0.9 -- in
detecting \textgreater/= 50\% stenosis) \citep{yaoAnkleSystolicPressure2005, ourielCriticalEvaluationStress1982}

0.0-0.5 & Severe PAD \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

\textbf{What is Exercise ABPI studies?}

Constant Load Testing -- (unlike the Graded Test -- Bruce Protocol).

The mechanism for changes in ABPI are related to the fact that exercise
increases SBP and decreases SVR and therefore will affect flow across a
stenosis making it more physiologically relevant during exercise.
\citep{nicolaiReliabilityTreadmillTesting2009, alqahtaniPredictorsChangeAnkleBrachial2018}

Walking distance has been shown to correlate with level and severity of
POAD. \citep{strandnessHemodynamicsSurgeons1975a}

Patients with single level iliac disease may present with buttock/thigh
claudication with preserved pulses. Exercise treadmill ABI particularly
useful in determining the severity of disease in these patients.
\citep{aboyansGeneralPrognosisPatients2010}

  asymptomatic disease and claudication}. \emph{Conte and Pomposelli et
  al.~JVS 2015} \citep{conteSocietyVascularSurgery2015}
\end{itemize}

Other Guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  TASC 1 -2
\item
  European Guidelines (2017)
\item
  AHA Guidelines (last update 2016)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the initial management of Asymptomatic Patients with PAD?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Smoking Cessation -- Multidisciplinary comprehensive smoking
  cessation interventions -- repeatedly until tobacco use has stopped
  (Grade A -- 1)
\item
  Intervention is not only not recommended, but invasive treatment is
  recommended against, in the absence of symptoms (Grade A -1)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{How can we medically (non-invasively) manage Asymptomatic PAOD based
on the SVS Guidelines?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Anti-platelet Therapy

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis Trial -- n=3350,

    benefit unknown
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Statin Therapy

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The Heart Protection Study
    \citep{heartprotectionstudycollaborativegroupRandomizedTrialEffects2007} -
    this study looked at Statins in patients with PAD but not
    completely asymptomatic, they had other risk factors such as
    diabetes, IHD, cerebral disease or hypertension. Without these
    risk factors Statin therapy benefit unsure.
  \item
    However, the AHA from the Framingham Study does recommend using
    Statins if 10-year risk based on risk calculators \textgreater7.5\% (which
    would be positive if PAD present).

\textbf{How can we medically manage Intermittent Claudication based on the SVS
Guidelines?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Smoking Cessation -- Multidisciplinary comprehensive smoking
  cessation interventions -- repeatedly until tobacco use has stopped
  (Grade A -- 1)
\item
  Dyslipidaemia: Statin Therapy Recommended -- most recent evidence on
  lipid therapy has suggested focusing on reducing 10-year
  cardiovascular event risk rather than specifically reducing lipid
  levels. (Grade 1-A)
\item
  Statin Therapy -- Aspirin therapy (75-325mg daily) is recommended to
  reduce cardiovascular events in patients with PAD (Grade 1-Level A)
  \citep{collaborationCollaborativeMetaanalysisRandomised2002}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    There is evidence that Clopidogrel 75mg compared to Aspirin is
    better in event reduction
    (CAPRIE)\citep{capriesteeringcommitteeRandomisedBlindedTrial1996}--
    replacing Aspirin with Clopidogrel Grade 1-Level B)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Diabetes Mellitus -- Optimization of HbA1C \textless{} 7\% (Grade 1-Level B)
\item
  Hypertension -- Indicated B-Blockers for hypertension (Grade 1-Level

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi})}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \tightlist
  \item
    (there's no evidence that Beta Blockers worsens IC)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Homocysteine -- Recommendation against Folic Acid and Vit B12 (
  Grade 2 -- C)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{To improve Limb Function in patients with IC:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cilostozol use -- IC without CHF -- 3-month Trial (Grade 2 - A)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If unable to tolerate Cilostozol -- Pentoxifylline (400mg TDS)
    (Grade 2 -- B)
  \item
    Based on Meta-analysis 26 trials
    \citep{stevensSystematicReviewEfficacy2012}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Exercise Therapy

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    First Line Therapy recommended SEP: minimum three times / week
    (30-60 min/session) for at least 12 weeks (Grade 1 Level A)
  \item
    Meta-analysis of 32 RCT's: Placebo versus exercise: Walking
    Time, Walking Ability, Pain Free Walking and maximum walking
    distance improves. BUT no difference in ABPI, Mortality or
    amputation. \citep{laneExerciseIntermittentClaudication2017}
  \item
    Meta- Analysis of 14RCT's: SEP better than Non-Supervised
    Programs. \citep{hagemanSupervisedExerciseTherapy2018}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the management for patients with Intermittent Claudication?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  With appropriate medical management and risk modification, 25\% of
  patients will improve, 50\% will remain stable and 25\% will progress
  and requiring intervention. \citep{conte2015, norgren2007}
\item
  \textbf{Patient Selection for Intervention:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    20-30\% of patients with IC who adhere to risk factor
    modification will have progressive symptoms that will eventually
    be treated with intervention.
  \item
    Patient selection should be based on QoL and functional
    impairment in an active person (loss of ability to perform
    occupation or that limits basic activities of daily living)
    rather than haemodynamic (ABPI or US) or anatomical disease
    progression/severity.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Always remember multifactorial causes of immobility --
  particularly in the elderly.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    SVS recommends that invasive therapy for IC have a \textgreater50\%
    likelihood of sustained clinical improvement for at least 2
    years.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Anatomical Selection:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Aortoiliac Disease:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Previous TASC Classification has attempted to categorise
      anatomy of disease and subsequent recommendation of
      Endovascular versus open surgery. But as the authors of the
      SVS guidelines highlight, ``improvements in technology and
      endovascular techniques have resulted in EVT replacing open
      surgical bypass as a primary treatment for both focal and
      advanced AIOD in many cases.''
    \item
      The majority of evidence is non randomized and meta analyses
      of non-randomized series.
    \item
      Endovascular procedures over open surgery for focal AIOD
      causing IC. (Grade 1 Evidence B)
    \item
      Endovascular interventions as first line for CIA or EIZ
      occlusive disease-causing IC. (Grade 1 Level B)
    \item
      Hybrid recommended for Iliac disease involving CFA. (Grade 1
      Level B)
    \item
      Direct Surgical reconstruction (bypass, endarterectomy) in
      patients with reasonable surgical risk and diffuse AIOD not
      amenable to endovascular approach, after one or more failed
      attempts at EVT, or combined occlusive and aneurysmal
      disease. (Grade 1 Evidence B)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Infrainguinal Disease:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      When you look at the historical data comparing all EVT
      together they are less durable than surgical bypass,
      especially when there's diffuse or long segments of
      occlusion/multilevel infra inguinal disease.
    \item
      Most recommendations are based on low level evidence when
      comparing EVT versus Open Surgery
    \item
      Focal + Not involving SFA origin = EVT (Grade 1 Level C)
    \item
      SFA 5-15cm, self-expanding stent (with or without
      paclitaxel) (Grade 1 Level B) -- NB: (This was in 2015 pre
      Katsanos Paper)
    \item
      Recommend against infrapopliteal treatment for IC (Grade 1
      Level C)
    \item
      Initial Surgical Bypass (with vein: Grade 1 Level a): If

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Diffuse FP disease
      \item
        Small Calibre \textless5mm
      \item

\textbf{Since Our previous discussion of PAD how does this pathology then
progress clinically into the more advanced stages?}

The latter stages of both the Rutherford and Fontaine Classification
systems highlight this progression, with the Rutherford classification
of Stage 5 being specifically minor tissue loss with focal gangrene, and
stage 6 as major tissue loss identified by speeding of gangrene beyond
the Trans metatarsal level.

\textbf{What is Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia (CLTI), sometimes previously
call Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)?}

In the last decade leading up to the recent Global Vascular Guidelines
(GVG) published last year, the term (Chronic Limb threatening Ischaemia)
CLTI has been gradually replacing CLI. The GVG mentions that their
``promotion'' of the term CLTI is partly due to terms such as ``critical or
severe limb ischemia'' failing to ``recognize the full spectrum and
inter-relatedness of components beyond ischemia that contribute to major
limb amputation\ldots{}''

\textbf{What was the original definition and threshold for CLI and how can we
make sure we elicit the right symptoms from the patient?}

John Cranley back in his publication in 1969 defined Ischemic Rest Pain
as,

``\ldots pain that occurs in the toes or in the area of the metatarsal heads.
Occasionally\ldots in the foot proximal to the metatarsal heads. Elevation
of the limb above or at the horizontal position aggravates the pain and
pendency\ldots brings relief\ldots{}'' \citep{cranleyIschemicRestPain1969}

Nocturnal Rest Pain: Worse due to horizontal positioning and systolic BP
drop during sleep.

\hypertarget{evaluation-12}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-12}}

\textbf{What aspects of the clinical assessment is important?}

Clinical Assessment involves a full history (the differential mentioned
above) and examination.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Clinical Examination:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Bergers Test (Beurger 1908) / AKA Ratschows Test
    (Max-Ratschow-Klinic) identifies when there is critical ischemia
    without necrosis yet or gangrene, and is characterised by pallor
    when the leg is elevated above the level of the heart, which
    then turns red when hanging down over the edge of the bed. This
    redness is referred to as ``Sunset appearance'' and its due to
    abnormal autoregulation. Its been described that normally only a
    third of the capillary bed is open at any time but in a state of
    critical ischaemia because of the autoregulation being paralyzed
    a significantly higher portion of the capillaries open up.
  \item
    The ischaemic Angle: A refinement to Berger's Test: The angle of
    elevation from the horizontal at which the Doppler Signal of the
    PT or DP disappears. This is also referred to as the `pole
    test', whereby the foot is raised alongside a calibrated pole
    marked in mmHg.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Tissue Loss:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Gangrene Dry or Wet (infection)
  \item
    Level of tissue Loss
  \item
    Probing To Bone/ Exposed structures: Tendons, Soft Tissue, bone,
    Joint Capsule.
  \item
    Examination of an Ulcer (may have many aetiologies) -- important
    not only to identify extent of disease but also to exclude other
    aetiologies:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Such as Venous, Mixed, infective, autoimmune, inflammatory,
      malignancy or trauma.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Foot Infection - Signs of infection, erythema, rubor, cellulitis,
  tenderness or unexplained hyperglycemia in diabetic patients should
  prompt urgent referal.\citep{kalish2010}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the natural history of CLTI and what do we know about its
prognosis?}

Fortunately, only a small portion of patients with Intermittent
Claudication will go on to develop rest pain or tissue loss. Its
estimated that anywhere between 5\% -29\% of patients with PAD or IC go on
to develop CLTI over 5 years.

However, those that do develop CLTI, have a high risk of limb loss
(greater than 20\% annual risk) and a high mortality (10-15\% annual
risk), the majority of terminal events being related to cardiovascular
events. Limb loss or mortality may reach as high as 50\% in 1 year.
\citep{adam2005, norgren2007}

CLTI measurements most predictive of non-healing are ankle pressure
\textless50mmHg, ABI \textless0.4, TcPO2 \textless20mmHg, and TP
\textless20mmHg.\citep{gerhard-herman2017, wickström2017}

\textbf{What has changed in the last few decades?}

Prevalence of smokers-Ex and Current (decrease) and patients with
diabetes(increase).

Estimated 4.4\% of the world will have diabetes by 2030. 25\% of patients
with Diabetes will develop a foot ulcer.

\textbf{Briefly outline the underlying pathophysiology associated with
peripheral neuropathy in Diabetes?}

The loss of the basic nociceptive mechanisms in the foot amongst
diabetics, presents as a loss of protective sensation (LOPS).

Neuropathy can be divided into three types:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Sensory: ``stocking-glove'' distribution
\item
  Motor: Intrinsic muscle wasting -- resulting in deformities
\item
  Autonomic: Sympathetic nervous system pathology
\end{enumerate}

Along with Neuropathy, Diabetic Patients also have Structural
deformities and Gait disturbances in addition to Angiopathy or small
vessel disease.

There is often an overlap in the pathological processes in patients with
CLTI or CLI.

Diabetic foot ulcers have a very high rate of recurrence with 40\% of
patients developing a new ulcer within 12 months of healing a previous
ulcer. \citep{armstrong2017}

\textbf{What is the WIFI Classification?} \citep{millsSocietyVascularSurgery2014a}

Interestingly in the original article by Bob Rutherford regarding
Diabetes and PAD:

- ``It was generally agreed that diabetic patients who have a varied
clinical picture of neuropathy, ischemia and sepsis make the definition
even more difficult and it is desirable that these patients be
excluded\ldots diabetic patients should be clearly defined as a separate
category or should be clearly defined as a separate category.''

Since then, the SVS, while acknowledging that we can no longer exclude
these patients and treat them separately given the overlap, have decided
that a new classification system is necessary, as one of the key authors
(Joseph Mills) states:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``We classify things into groups to differentiate, remember and
  compare, observe and predict their behaviour over time.'' --Joseph
  Mills
\end{itemize}

WIfI stands for: Wound, Ischemia and foot Infection. Most of the
existing Vascular and non-Vascular classification systems don't include
all three components or fail to stratify the degree of ischemia and
presence of gangrene.

Principles of WIfI:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Grades, Classes and Stages -- Each of the three categories (WIfI)
  have Grades 0,1,2,3: Resulting in 64 Classes.
\item
  Delphi Consensus -- Clinical Stages 1 (Very Low),2 (Low), 3
  (Moderate), 4 (High Risk/Benefit).

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    What is the one-year risk of amputation with medical therapy
    alone?
  \item
    What is the potential benefit from successful revascularization?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Analogous to TNM Staging
\end{enumerate}

``It is intended to be an iterative process with the goal of more
precisely stratifying patients according to their initial disease
burden, analogous to TNM cancer staging, but not to dictate therapy.''

\textbf{What about a differential diagnosis or other causes of similar pain as
rest pain?}

Acute Lower Limb ischemia is a different clinical picture, but there may
some overlap with Acute on Chronic disease such as in the case of in
situ thrombosis in the lower limb arterial system.

Other causes of ischemic pain include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Buergers Disease, or Thromboangiitis obliterans - for more see
  \ref{buergers-disease}
\item
  Scleroderma
\item
  Fibromuscular dysplasia
\item
  Popliteal Artery Entrapment
\item
  Cystic Adventitial Disease
\item
  Persistent Sciatic Artery Disease
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the Rutherford Acute Ischemia Grading System?}

Although Acute Ischemia is very different from chronic ischemia,
patients with progressive chronic PAD can develop an acute picture
whether from embolism or in-situ thrombosis secondary to plaque rupture.
See \ref{acute-limb-ischemia} for more.

\textbf{What are the recent CLTI Guidelines?}

In 2019 the SVS, the ESVS and the World federation of Vascular Societies
(WFVS) joined forces to put together the structure and funding of the
Global Vascular Guidelines Initiative (GVG). Importantly all sponsorship
was directly from the societies and any direct industry sponsorship or
external sources were excluded. They put together a steering committee
responsible for recruiting a large and diverse writing group and
outlined the scope and developed the section briefs of the guideline.

They determined that:

``The term''critical limb ischemia'' (CLI) is outdated and fails to
encompass the full spectrum of patients who are evaluated and treated
for limb-threatening ischemia in modern practice.''

CLTI was promoted as the term of choice and was defined by the target
population

The target population were:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Ischemic Rest Pain with confirmatory hemodynamic studies
\item
  Diabetic Foot Ulcer or any lower limb ulceration present for at
  least 2 weeks
\item
  Gangrene involving any portion of the lower limb or foot
\end{enumerate}

Exclusion from the population:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Purely venous ulcers
\item
  Acute Limb Ischemia/acute trash foot/ischemia due to emboli
\item
  Acute Trauma or mangled extremity
\item
  Wounds secondary to non-atherosclerotic conditions
\end{enumerate}

Methodology of the guidelines utilised the structure of GRADE.

They Highlighted particular important sections in the evaluation and
management of patients with CLTI: namely Patient Risk stratification,
Limb Assessment and Severity of Limb Threat and the development of a
specific evidence-based revascularisation guideline in CLTI.

One think to notice (which the authors also highlight in the text body)
is compared to most guidelines, unfortunately in this area, particularly
when it comes to revascularisation, the level of evidence is generally
LOW. Again, highlighting the importance of these guidelines in
developing a standard approach and appropriately stratifying patients in
not only management but ongoing research.

\textbf{What clinical evaluation is necessary for the patient with CLTI?}

In addition to the History and Examination, and the WIfI assessment
mentioned above. For patients with diabetes and an ulcer a full
assessment of neuropathy and a ``probe to bone'' test for any open ulcers
is recommended as part of good practice.

We mentioned in our previous discussion the non-invasive methods of
assessment for these patients. One additional point to make is the
importance of TP and TBI in these patients.

It's been shown that, healing of an ulcer or tissue loss is unlikely if
a patient's toe pressures are less than 55mmHg. And Toe Pressures have
been validated in multiple studies to correlate with Amputation free
survival and wound healing: Amputation Free Survival TP \textless30mmHg 2.13 HR
(1.52-2.98). \citep{wickström2017, hicks2018}

Patients with ESRD or DM develop medial calcification and often have
elevated ABI (\textgreater1.3) - which is associated with an elevated risk of
cardiovascular mortality. Toe pressures are particularly important in
this scenario. \citep{resnick2004, vitti1994}

Non-invasive assessment for wound healing, tcPO2 greater than 40mmHg has
the greatest correlation with amputation stump healing.\citep{malone1987}

\hypertarget{management-18}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-18}}

\textbf{What are the recommendations for patients with CLTI when it comes to
Medical Therapy and Risk Factor Modification?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Treat all patients with CLTI with an antiplatelet agent \textbf{(Grade 1
  Level A)}
\item
  Consider Clopidogrel as the single agent (\textbf{Grade 2 Level B}) --
  CAPRIE\citep{capriesteeringcommittee1996}
\item
  High-intensity statin therapy to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular
  mortality - Atorvastatin 80mg or Rosuvastatin 40mg (\textbf{Grade 1 Level
  A}) \citep{arya2018, 2013acc}
\item
  Control Hypertension to BP target \textless140mm Hg systolic and \textless90mm Hg
  diastolic in patients with CLTI (\textbf{Grade 1 Level B})
\item
  Offer Smoking Cessation interventions and ask all smokers or former
  smokers about status of tobacco use every visit (\textbf{Grade 1 Level
  A})
\item
  Diabetic foot wounds with signs of infection, erythema, swelling,
  pain and foul smelling drainage should be treated with IV abx, plain
  radiography, ESR, CRP and cultures. Signs of systemic sepsis, such
  as fevers, tachycardia or shock, such as hypotension, should warrant
  urgent debridement and drainage, regardless of vascular status.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What imaging assessment is required?}

The CLTI Guidelines outlines an algorithm of attaining Arterial Anatomy
Imaging. Starting with US and then depending on the information
required, CTA, MRA or eventually digital subtraction angiography. They
emphasize the importance of obtaining good quality imaging to
appropriately stage and be able to compare the level and degree of
disease.

For wounds with concern for underlying osteomyelitis - initial workup is
with plain radiography, which can identify soft tissue emphysema,
evidence of osteomyelitis or presence of a foreign body. High suspicion
of early osteomyelitis with negative x-ray may warrent an MRI to
detect.\citep{giurato2017}

\textbf{What is the Global Limb Anatomic Staging System (GLASS)?}
\citep{conteGlobalVascularGuidelines2019a}

Because the existing arterial anatomical staging of disease is very
vague, and are ``lesion focussed'' and not all encompassing (beyond the
concept of `in-line pulsatile flow to the foot'), GLASS attempts to
incorporate all aspects in its staging to improve vascular care and
evidence-based revascularisation (EBR) outcomes.~

GLASS incorporates two novel and important concepts: The Target Arterial
Path (TAP) and the estimated Limb-Based Patency (LBP) and it's a grading
system based on anatomical and subjective assessment of calcification.

GLASS focusses on Infrainguinal disease, with the Aorto Iliac (AI)
segment considered the inflow disease which includes the Common Femoral
Artery and the Profunda Artery. Therefore, the GLASS grades assume the
inflow vessels are treated and adequately `dealt with'.~

Infrainguinal disease assessment for Femoropoliteal (FP) and
Infrapopliteal (IP) is based on length of disease and the extent of
CTO's. The FP and IP GLASS Grades are then combined into Stages 1-3.~

The calcification scale is a dichotomous subjective assessment of the
degree of calcification and if there is \textgreater50\% circumference of
calcification, diffuse or bulky calcification or ``coral reef'' plaques,
then there is an increase in the within-segment grade by one numerical
value.

There is also mention of the Inframaleolar (IM) degree of disease (PO,
P1-absent arch, P2-no target artery crossing into foot) which is not
included in the GLASS staging given little evidence on the outcomes this
difference makes on overall patency and limb salvage.

Once the GRADES (0-4) of FP and IP disease are determined then staging
(1-3) can be performed based on the matrix or grid that is provided.
Staging then allows for estimated Peripheral endo-Vascular Intervention
outcomes (PVI) to be predicted, Immediate Technical Failure (ITF - \textless10\%
or \textless{} 20\% or \textgreater{} 20\%)) and 1-year Limb Based Patency (LBP - \textgreater70\%, 50-75\%
or \textless50\%).~

\textbf{What is the Target Arterial Path (TAP)?}

``The selected continuous route of in-line flow from groin to ankle. The
TAP typically involves the least diseased IP artery but may be angiosome
based.''

\textbf{What revascularisation management strategies exist for CLTI?}

The mainstay of management for patients with CLI or CLTI has always been
based on the fundamental principle of limb salvage and given the high
risk of limb loss in these patients there's been a low threshold to
revascularize these patients if they have occlusive disease that is
treatable. But strategy has varied significantly.

The CLTI Guidelines provide an approach to dealing with this complex
condition on planning three aspects to each case:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Patient Risk Estimation
\item
  Limb Staging
\item
  Anatomic Pattern of Disease
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What is involved with the Patient Risk Estimation?}

Good Practice Statements (Recommendations section 6)

``Refer all patients with suspected CLTI to a vascular specialist for
consideration of limb salvage, unless major amputation is considered
medically urgent.''

``Offer primary amputation or palliation to patients with limited life
expectancy, poor functional status (e.g.~non ambulatory), or an
unsalvageable limb after shared decision-making.''

Recommendation 6.3:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Estimate periprocedural risk and life expectancy in patients with
  CLTI who are candidates for revascularization. \textbf{Grade 1 (Strong)
  Level of Evidence C (Low)}
\item
  Average Surgical Risk: \textbackslash\textless5\% operative mortality and 2-year
  survival \textgreater50\%
\item
  Severe Surgical Risk: \textbackslash\textgreater/= 5\% operative mortality and 2-year
  survival \textless/=50\%
\end{itemize}

Understanding disparities is important when interpreting risk for
amputation. Observational studies have found certain populations to be
at higher risk of amputation regardless of disease severity, these
include African Americans, lowest median income, medicaid insurance,
uninsured, or those from regions with less access to vascular
surgeons.\citep{hughes2019, ho2005, eslami2007}

\textbf{What is involved and recommended with the Limb Staging and
recommendation for Management?}

Use an integrated threatened limb classification system (such as WIfI)
to stage all CLTI patients who are candidates for limb salvage. \textbf{Grade
1 (Strong) Level of Evidence C (Low)}

Perform urgent surgical drainage and debridement (including minor
amputation if needed) and commence antibiotic treatment in all patients
with suspected CLTI who present with deep space foot infection or wet
gangrene. (Good Practice Statement)

Offer Revascularisation to all ``average surgical risk patients'' (\textbackslash\textless5\%
operative mortality and 2-year survival \textgreater50\%) with advanced
limb-threatening conditions (e.g.~WIfI stage 4) and significant
perfusion deficits (e.g.~ischemia grades 2 and 3). Particularly if they
have good saphenous vein. \textbf{Grade 1 (Strong) Level of Evidence C (Low)}
\citep{adam2005, norgren2007}

\textbf{What is involved in the Planning of the Anatomic pattern of disease
and its effects of revascularisation strategy?}

The overall pattern of arterial occlusive disease is a dominant factor
in guiding type of revascularisation and timing of such.

\textbf{Do all patients require direct in-line flow to the foot as a primary
technical outcome with revascularisation?}

One important patient population to identify that do not necessarily
require direct in line flow are those with rest pain ``for which
correction of inflow disease alone or treatment of FP disease even
without continuous tibial runoff to the foot may provide relief of
symptoms. This may also be the case in patients presenting with minor
degrees of tissue loss.''

\textbf{What are some essential Key Factors to consider before deciding Open
versus Endovascular according to the CLTI guidelines?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{The ``availability of and quality of autogenous vein conduit''7}
\item
  \textbf{Patient overall risk (as mentioned above) and Limb Staging}
\item
  \textbf{The Target EndoVascular Intervention (TVI) outcomes}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What evidence do we have for deciding between Endo and Open? What is
the BASIL trial?}

The evidence is largely retrospective or non-controlled, industry
sponsored and in overall quality poor. BASIL (Bypass versus Angioplasty
in Severe Ischemia of the Leg) remains the only multicentre RCT (BASIL
-2 and 3 underway) directly comparing an endo versus open strategy in
CLTI and Infra-inguinal occlusive disease.~

BASIL compared POBA and Bypass across multiple centres (27 centres,
n=452, 1999-2004) in the UK. Primary endpoint was amputation-free
survival. \citep{bradburyBypassAngioplastySevere2005}

Major Findings:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  At 6-months follow up: no difference in AFS.
\item
  Intention-To-Treat Analysis of overall follow up showed no
  significant difference in AFS and overall survival.
\item
  Among patients who survived \textgreater2 years, overall survival was better
  for those treated with Bypass as a first approach
\item
  Analysis to treat:~

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Prosthetic Bypass Patients did very poorly (even compared to
    POBA)~~
  \item
    Patients who had bypass after failed POBA had significantly
    worse AFS compared to those treated with a bypass as initial
    treatment
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Criticism:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Majority had POBA alone (not currently best endovascular option)
\item
  25 \% of Open Bypass were Prosthetic
\item
  The Technology and Technical Skill with growing operator experience
  in Endovascular has improved.
\end{enumerate}

For isolated tibial disease, first line endovascular treatment of choice
is transluminal or subintimal angioplasty. Atherectomy, stenting, and
drug coated balloons are often used, but should not be considered first
line at this time, but this data is rapidly evolving. Patency is often
poor but limb salvage is reasonable.\citep{popplewell2019, kayssi2016, mustapha2016}

Optimal followup for endovascular interventinos of the lower extremity
have not been established, but should at least include a pulse exam, ABI
and duplex to establish a new baseline after intervention.\citep{zierler2018, mohler2012}

\textbf{What is new with the future management guidance for CTLI? What is
BASIL 2 and 3 and BEST-CLI?}

BASIL 2: Infrapopliteal Disease: Vein Bypass First vs.~Best Endovascular
Treatment first

BASIL 3: PBA +/- BMS vs.~DCB +/- BMS vs.~DES

(Both Follow up 24-60 months, Primary Endpoint AFS)

BEST-CLI:~ Open Bypass versus Endovascular Intervention, Primary
Endpoint: MALE-Free Survival.~ Major Above-the-Ankle Amputation, Major
Bypass or Jump/interposition graft revision or the need for thrombectomy
or thrombolysis (MALE).

\textbf{Some important take away lessons for unique scenarios in operative
planning for CLTI based on anatomy and conduit.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Single segment GSV best conduit for infrageniculate bypass.
  \citep{arvela2010, avgerinos2015, moreira2016}
\item
  Fem-AK pop bypass with prosthetic may be preferred to contralateral
  GSV. \citep{moreira2016}
\item
  Bilateral external iliac occlusion may be best treated with end to
  side aorto-bifemoral bypass to allow for continued perfusion of the
  pelvis. \citep{jaquinandi2008, vandenakker1992, brewster1978}
\item
  Profunda-popliteal collateral index (Segmental pressures AK-BK/AK)
  of less than 0.25 may suggest that there is sufficient collateral
  network between profunda and popliteal that SFA treatment may not be
  necessary. \citep{boren1980, mawatari2000}
\item
  Mal perforans ulcer over the R first metatarsel head with long
  occlusion of BK pop, PT and AT with reconstitution of the DP and PT
  should have an AK pop to DP bypass to perfuse the appropriate
  angiosome with the shortest bypass.\citep{hingorani2016, jongsma2017}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{complications-1}{%
\subsubsection{Complications}\label{complications-1}}

\textbf{What are some complications of lower extermity revascularization
procedures?}

For a comprehensive list of access complications after endovascular
therapy, see \ref{access-comp}.

Femoral exploration carries high risk for infection or lymphatic leak.
Lymphatic leaks often resolve spontaneously if they are small and can
avoid super-infection. Infected lymphatic leaks, particularly in the
setting of prosthetic bypass require exploration. Often times definitive
therapy requires alcohol ablation or muscle flap coverage. The most
important aspect of lymph leak is prevention with careful dissection and
tissue management during femoral exploration.\citep{obara2014, weaver2014}

\textbf{Some important things to keep in mind when considering amputations}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Transmetatersal amputation is performed with transection of the
  metatarsal bones just distal to the heads. Best to transect in a
  graduated parabola with the 5th metatarsal most proximal. Patients
  may benefit from concomitant achilles tendon lengthening to prevent
  equinous deformity that can result in ulceration of the medial
  aspect of the TMA.\citep{eidt2019}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{acute-limb-ischemia-1}{%
\section{Acute Limb Ischemia}\label{acute-limb-ischemia-1}}

\textbf{17 Oct 2020:} \emph{Alex Forsyth and Sarah Carlson; Boston Univeristy}

\textbf{What is acute limb ischemia and what does it encompass?}

Acute limb ischemia is defined as any process that leads to an abrupt
cessation of blood flow to a limb resulting in ischemia. There are a few
causes, but the most common two are embolic and thrombotic.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Embolic

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Cardiac

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Typically due to a fib
    \item
      Arm ischemia is most commonly due to cardiac embolism~
    \item
      Endocarditis -- as seen in IV drug users or patients with
      bacteremia from other causes
    \item
      Cardiac tumors -- such as atrial myxoma
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Atherosclerotic (e.g.~iliac disease embolizing downstream to the
    lower leg)
  \item
    Paradoxical embolism (Thromboembolic venous system with PFO)~
  \item
    Aneurysm (e.g.~thrombus from within an aortic aneurysm
    embolizing downstream to the leg)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Thrombosis

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Aneurysm
  \item
    Bypass graft
  \item
    Acute on chronic progression of atherosclerosis
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dissection
\item
  Thoracic outlet syndrome (in the upper extremity)
\item
  Vasospasm (severe)
\end{itemize}

For clarification: (1) Acute on chronic progression of atherosclerosis:~
-- e.g.~once a chronic stenosis becomes critically tight, platelet
thrombus can develop leading to an acute occlusion; or unstable plaque
can ``rupture'' leading to an acute occlusion of a chronic lesion.~ And
(2) Regarding aneurysms -- especially small aneurysms (such as
popliteal) -- these are less likely to rupture, but more likely to
thrombose and cause an acute limb ischemic event.

\hypertarget{presentation-and-diagnosis-1}{%
\subsection{Presentation and Diagnosis}\label{presentation-and-diagnosis-1}}

\textbf{What is the patient presentation of ALI? Are there any differences for
upper vs.~lower extremity presentations?}

Classically remembered by the 5 or 6 Ps depending on who you ask

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Pain: usually located distal to the occlusion and gradually
  increases in severity as the duration of ischemia continues. The
  pain may also decrease after a time due to ischemic sensory loss
\item
  Pallor: the limb appears pale compared to the non ischemic limb.
  There is delayed capillary refill as well
\item
  Poikiolothermia: (just a way to make ``cold'' into a ``P'' -- really
  means cold limb) means literally the inability to regulate one's
  body temperature, or dependent on ambient temperature as cold
  blooded animals are. If there is no perfusion of warm blood to the
  limb, it acclimates to the ambient temperature.~
\item
  Pulseless: self explanatory, but a good thing to think about is if
  the contralateral limb has normal pulses, it suggests the absence of
  chronic limb ischemia and that an embolus or other cause of ALI.~
\item
  Paresthesia and Paralysis are the last two Ps. Paresthesias are an
  earlier sign of ischemic nerve dysfunction and paralysis is a later
  sign. In the lower extremity, ischemic changes often affect the
  anterior compartment first, and sensory loss over the dorsum of the
  foot is one of the earlier neurologic deficits in ALI
\end{itemize}

This is why a thorough physical exam is key; comparison of both limbs
and a good pulse exam including handheld doppler exam.~ It can be
difficult for a junior resident to tell whether a limb is acutely
threatened, especially in patients with chronic disease where the
presentation of an acute change can be more subtle.~ This is why the
attending surgeon will always ask the consult resident ``how is the motor
and sensory function'' in addition to the pulse exam\ldots this helps us
gauge the chronicity and therefore the urgency of intervention.

Acute paralysis, mottling of bilateral lower extremities and absent
femoral pulses should raise concern for aortic occlusion.\citep{wang2016}

\textbf{How is ALI classified?}

From Rutherford RB, Baker JD, Ernst C, et \,al.~Recommended standards for
reports dealing with lower extremity ischemia: revised version. J Vasc

\textbf{What does the work up for an acute limb entail? How is the diagnosis
made?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The diagnosis can often be made on history, physical exam, and
  bilateral ABIs. Imaging can be done in patients in who the diagnosis
  is uncertain
\item
  As with most urgent cases, the type of imaging done depends on the
  availability of at your institution, but generally imaging, such as
  a CT angiography or arteriography should be done on viable and
  marginally threatened limbs. Arteriography often can distinguish
  between embolic vs arterial thrombosis which may help to direct
  therapy.
\end{itemize}

The situation varies depending on how severe the presentation is and how
quickly you can obtain imaging.~ Also depends on renal function and
whether you want accept two contrast loads (CT followed by endovascular
intervention).~ As a rule of thumb, if I can feel femoral pulses I would
typically be more inclined to proceed with on-table angiogram without a
CT scan.~ If femoral pulses are absent I would be more concerned about
aortoiliac disease and I would prefer to have a CT scan so I know what
I'm getting into in the operating room and can have a better plan.

In patients with severe renal insufficiency, MRA or MR time-of-flight
can be helpful, but these studies usually take a little longer to obtain
and may not be quickly available in an acute threatened limb situation.
Consider going straight to angiography, as to get the most immediate and
best imaging of the tibial vessels. \citep{creagerClinicalPracticeAcute2012, earnshaw100AcuteLimb2019}

Bedside ultrasound can also be very helpful even if you're not a
certified ultrasonographer yourself, if you have access to color flow
doppler US it can be very helpful.

\hypertarget{management-19}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-19}}

\textbf{What is normally done in the initial management of ALI?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Anticoagulation - IV unfractionated heparin is immediately
  administered to prevent proximal and distal progression of secondary
  thrombus as long as heparin is not contraindicated. The dose should
  be titrated to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time
  between 50 and 80 seconds (2-3 times normal values)
\item
  Supportive care (IV fluids)
\item
  A full set of labs including serum chemistry panel with BUN and Cr,
  CBC, baseline coagulation studies should be obtained. Baseline
  plasma CPK can be helpful to follow for evidence of rhabdomyolysis
  after reperfusion
\end{itemize}

A good rule of thumb for IV heparin is to start with a bolus of 80-100
units/kg, and then drop at 18units/kg/hr -- titrating to PTT at 2-3x
normal

\textbf{What are some of the options for treatment of ALI?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Medical primarily with anticoagulation using heparin or a direct Xa
  inhibitor
\item
  Acute on chronic limb ischemia may be more technically challenging
  and require more complex reconstruction with a combination of
  endovascular and open techniques. \citep{dedonatoAcuteChronicLimb2018, creagerClinicalPracticeAcute2012}
\item
  Open

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Thrombectomy -- balloon catheter based (Fogarty embolectomy
    balloon -- Dr.~Fogarty invented this while he was a medical
    student)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Patients with acute limb ischemia, neuro deficit and distal
      pop embolism may be best treated with popliteal exposure and
      open thrombectomy. \citep{darwoodSurgeryThrombolysisInitial2018, kempeResultsSurgicalManagement2014}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Bypass

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Patients with aortic occlusion and significant
      comorbidities, and significant aortoiliac baseline disease
      may likely benefit from primary axillo-bifemoral bypass.
      \citep{mohapatraRiskFactorsPerioperative2018}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Endarterectomy -- not usually the go to but might be used for
    the common femoral~
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Endovascular~

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Pharmacologic catheter directed thrombolysis

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Absolute contraindications include active bleeding disorder,
      CVA (\textless6mo), CNS injury or head injury (\textless3mo), or GI bleed
      (\textless10d).
    \item
      Relative contraindications include recent major surgery,
      uncontrolled hypertension, intracranial tumor, pregnancy,
      recent eye surgery, hepatic failure, CPR (\textless10d), or
      bacterial endocarditis.
    \item
      1-2\% risk of hemorrhagic stroke. If neurologic deficit
      develops during thrombolysis, stop lysis and perform
      immediate head CT.
      \citep{ourielComparisonRecombinantUrokinase1998}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Percutaneous thrombus aspiration -- useful for small fresh
    thrombi such as after angioplasty, as distal diameter of the
    catheter tip limits the size of the thrombus that can be
    removed.~
  \item
    Mechanical thrombolysis and aspiration are also useful for
    patients with contraindications for thrombolytic therapy, and
    also may allow for a lower dose of a thrombolytic agent, but
    risk damage to the arterial wall
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Who gets which kinds of treatment? Who needs emergent treatment?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Class I might just need medical therapy like anticoagulation and
  revascularization can be elective.~
\item
  Class IIb patients do not need immediate revascularization

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If symptoms have been present for less than 2 weeks endovascular
    therapy is preferred
  \item
    If more than 2 weeks or lytic therapy has failed then surgical
    intervention is preferred~
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Class IIb need immediate revascularization. Historically surgical
  revascularization has been preferred because of its immediacy, but
  catheter directed thrombolysis and percutaneous mechanical
  thrombectomy have shortened time to revascularization.~
\item
  Studies:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    STILE trial -- one of the first large RCTs comparing catheter
    thrombolysis with open surgery; overall the study showed some
    short term benefit to open surgery however this can probably be
    attributed to a couple things: (1) in 28\% of patients randomized
    to CDT they weren't able to get a catheter in place so these
    patients were considered treatment failures and crossed over to
    the surgery arm, and (2) patients with very long durations of
    ischemia -- up to 6 months) were randomized, and when they
    looked at patients who had been symptomatic for less than 2
    weeks, the thrombolysis patients actually did better.
    \citep{thestileinvestigatorsResultsProspectiveRandomized1994}
  \item
    TOPAS trial -- larger RCT which enrolled patients who had an
    acute arterial occlusion of less than 14 days; this showed no
    difference in mortality or amputation-free survival but higher
    major bleeding in the CDT group.
    \citep{ourielComparisonRecombinantUrokinase1998}
  \item
    Meta analysis released originally published in 2002 but updated
    in 2013 and 2018 demonstrated no difference in mortality or limb
    salvage between surgical and thrombolytic therapy, but
    endovascular demonstrated higher rates of complications
    including ongoing limb ischemia and bleeding within 30 days of
    treatment. Previously they had reported higher rates of stroke
    in the thrombolysis category but the most recent update is
    unable to support this finding
    \citep{darwoodSurgeryThrombolysisInitial2018}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      All this to say, it is very reasonable to think about a
      cathter-directed therapy especially if the presentation is
      acute, less than 2 weeks or so.~ That said, there are
      certain anatomical locations that most surgeons would favor
      a simple open procedure -- e.g.~embolism to the common
      femoral or brachial arteries -- these are typically pretty
      simple to treat with a cut down and balloon thrombectomy.~~
    \item
      One thing it is important to consider when doing a
      therapeutic infusion is that you might place a tPA infusion
      catheter at time zero and then bring the patient back 24
      hours later; patient needs to be advised that they'll need
      to lie flat for a day or even two days.~ Setting
      expectations with patients is important.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Class III is usually treated with primary amputation because
  revascularization is unlikely to restore function to the limb and
  restoring bloodflow can cause the patient serious harm.~
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are the risks of revascularization for a class III or prolonged
ischemia?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Myonephropathic metabolic syndrome: muscle cells undergo
  liquefactive necrosis due to ischemia. Potassium, myoglobin, lactic
  acid, and superoxide accumulate and can perfuse through the body or
  can have a sudden increase in the event of revascularization which
  leads to hyperkalemia, arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, metabolic
  acidosis, myoglobinuria, and can even cause sudden death from heart
  and/or renal failure. \citep{obaraAcuteLimbIschemia2018} Treatment of
  this is largely supportive with fluids
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{compartment-syndrome}{%
\section{Compartment Syndrome}\label{compartment-syndrome}}

\textbf{What is the pathophysiology and manifestations of compartment
syndrome?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Increased intramuscular compartment pressure results from increases
  in capillary permeability due to ischemic reperfusion. The increase
  in pressure leads to neuromuscular dysfunction and interferes with
  circulation. Irreversible damage occurs when pressures exceed 30mmHg
  in each compartment~~
\item
  Ischemia reperfusion causes increased capillary permeability due to
  free oxygen radicals, neutrophils and endothelial factors that
  collect during ischemia. Severity depends on time to reperfusion,
  muscle mass, and flow pattern (i.e.~direct or collateral). Symptoms
  often develop within 6hr of reperfusion. \citep{vonkeudell2015}
\item
  The pathophysiology underlying acute extremity compartment syndrome
  is related to the arteriovenous pressure gradient theory. Increased
  compartment pressure reduces the gradient -- reduces arterial
  pressure and increases venous pressure.\citep{frink2010, mcqueen1996, elliott2003, papalambros1989}
\item
  Clinically they can have neurological dysfunction with sensory motor
  deficits, but the most common presentation is a tense extremity with
  pain on passive movement of the muscles in the compartment, which is
  often dorsiflexion/plantar flexion of the ankle. A sensitive
  indicator is loss of two point discrimination
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How do you diagnose a compartment syndrome?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Physical exam (tenderness, especially over anterior compartment),
  paresthesias, especially between first and second toes

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Anterior compartment: deep peroneal nerve (this is a VSITE
    favorite)
  \item
    Deep posterior compartment: tibial nerve\citep{velmahos2002}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Compartment pressures:~ how do you do this?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Need a needle to access the compartment and a pressure
    monitoring system (can be handheld Stryker kit, or just a hollow
    bore needle connected to an arterial pressure bag).
  \item
    Normal compartment pressure is \textless10-20mmHg; greater than 30 is
    highly concerning.~ Probably even more accurate than an absolute
    number is comparing the compartment pressure to the mean
    arterial pressure or diastolic pressure.~ If the compartment
    pressure is within 40mmHg of the MAP (for example, MAP is 60 and
    compartment pressure is 25 -- this is concerning) -- OR -- if
    the difference between compartment pressure and diastolic
    pressure is less than 10 (for example, diastolic pressure is low
    at 30, and compartment pressure is 22).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If clinical suspicion of compartment syndrome is high, I tend not to be
reassured by ``normal'' compartment pressures.~ It's relatively low risk
to do fasciotomies, but the risk of limb loss is so high for a missed
compartment syndrome\ldots I would much rather err on the side of caution if
there's any question.

\textbf{Treatment is a fasciotomy -- can you tell us a little about the types
of fasciotomies?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Forearm and upper arm fasciotomies are often performed by orthopedic
  or hand surgeons. The forearm fasciotomy includes dorsal and volar
  incisions to release the dorsal and volar compartment, and mobile
  wad while avoiding numerous superficial cutaneous nerves. The arm
  fasciotomy releases the medial, lateral, and deltoid compartments
  through medial lateral incisions~
\item
  Fasciotomies can be done in the thigh as well with a medial and
  lateral incision to release the lateral, medial and posterior
  compartment
\item
  The most common type is a lower leg 4 compartment fasciotomy~
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How is a lower leg 4 compartment fasciotomy for the lower extremity
performed?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A longitudinal incision is created between the fibular shaft and the
  crest of the tibia over the intermuscular septum and the anterior
  and lateral compartments are opened. If tissues are swollen
  occluding the view of the intermuscular septum, the perforating
  vessels can be followed down to it. Nerves including the peroneal
  nerve are most at risk near the fibular head
\item
  A second incision is created on the medial surface of the lower leg
  approx. 1cm posterior to the edge of the tibia to avoid the greater
  saphenous vein. The superficial posterior compartment is incised.
  The gastrocnemius-soleus complex is taken down from its attachments
  to the tibia in order to access the deep posterior compartment.~
\item
  The incisions are made generously -- sometimes the skin incision can
  be a little short of the fascial incision, but they should be nice
  and long in order to fully release the compartments
\item
  After hemostasis be sure to apply loose dressings, and the leg
  should be elevated to reduce edema that can complicate closure.
  Closure can be done in 48-72 hours but may be delayed and dressed
  with wound vacs to attempt primary closure. If primary closure is
  not possible, a split thickness skin graft can be used for closure~
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Who should a prophylactic fasciotomy be performed on?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Patients with high occlusion and extensive ischemia,~
\item
  Acute ischemia of greater than 6 hours with few collaterals
\item
  Patients with combined arterial and venous injury
\item
  Patients who are obtunded making serial examination difficult
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the prognosis for a patient with ALI? What are some patient
factors that lead to a poor prognosis?}

Amputation rates after acute limb ischemia are typically described in
the 10-20\% range, and mortality is also in the 10-25\% range whether
you're talking about surgery or catheter-directed procedures (that's
excluding the patients who present with Rutherford class III and by
definition have an unsalvageable limb).~ Many factors determine
likelihood of amputation; typically, patients with more medical comorbid
conditions tend to do worse as you might expect:~ baseline CAD, kidney
disease and smoking are predictive of worse outcomes.~ There is a trend
toward improved limb salvage rates (decreased amputation rate) over
time, and I think this speaks to wider availability of different limb
salvage techniques among vascular surgeons across the globe.

Blue toe syndrome is characterized as a painful discolored toe in the
setting of a normal vascular examination or palpable pulses.

Acute onset of blue toe after MI - consider cholesterol embolization
from wire manipulation in the aorta.
\citep{saricAorticAtherosclerosisEmbolic2012}

\hypertarget{evaluation-13}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-13}}

Patients should have a work up for an embolic source. Patients without a
clear recent source of embolization on history or physical, should
undergo CTA of chest/abdomen/pelvis to look for an arterial lesion,
echocardiogram to identify a cardiac source, and a Holter monitor to
evaluate for an underlying arrhythmias.

If no obvious source of embolism can be identified, further evaluation
for underlying cancer may lead to a prothrombotic state.

\hypertarget{management-20}{%

Treatment of blue toe from cholesterol embolization best with single

embolization. \citep{ghahramaniPostproceduralBlueToes2016, quinonesCholesterolEmboliSyndrome2013}

Treatment of blue toe from a specific thrombogenic arterial lesion may
be best with anticoagulation. Recurrent symptoms on anticoagulation may
require stent coverage or, in a young patient, may require thrombectomy.

\textbf{UNDER CONSTRUCTION - This Chapter is Currently in DRAFT mode}

\textbf{09 Apr 2020}: \emph{Matt Chia, MD and Nick Mouawad, MD}

Mesenteric vascular disease can be broken down into three disease states
that we'll cover today. There's the arterial disease, which is clearly
separated into acute mesenteric ischemia and chronic mesenteric
ischemia. Then there is venous disease, which we'll touch on briefly.
There are also a handful of somewhat related diseases that we'll also
sprinkle into these discussions, like median arcuate ligament syndrome
and SMA syndrome, but that's overall where we're headed.

Mesenteric collatorals are important for protecting against mesenteric
ischemia. The gastroduodenal and pacreaticoduodenal arteries connect the
celiac and SMA. The meandering artery (arc of riolan) and marginal
artery of Drummond connect IMA and SMA. Hemorrhoidal branches connect
internal iliacs and IMA. \citep{chandraChronicMesentericIschemia2010, vangulikAnastomosisRiolanRevisited2005}

\hypertarget{acute-mesenteric-ischemia}{%
\section{Acute Mesenteric Ischemia}\label{acute-mesenteric-ischemia}}

\hypertarget{presentation-and-evaluation}{%
\subsection{Presentation and Evaluation}\label{presentation-and-evaluation}}

\textbf{Can you tell me about the classic presentation and approach to
patients presenting with acute mesenteric ischemia?}

These patients present with the sudden onset of abdominal pain. Nausea,
vomiting, distention, and diarrhea (possibly bloody, described as
``sudden and forceful evacuation'') are the common symptoms. Pain out of
proportion is the classic buzzword, and can be hidden on multiple choice
tests with a pain score of 10/10 with only mild abdominal tenderness on
physical exam.

Etiology most often from acute embolism (40-50\%), which is often
secondary to cardiac source (atrial fibrillation or recent
MI).\citep{wyersmarkcandmartin133AcuteMesenteric2019}

Vitals typically normal, possible tachycardia.

Lab evaluation typically unremarkable. Leukocytosis, hemoconcentration,
and acidosis (high anion gap) all are frequently found, but the absence
of these definitely does \textbf{not} rule out acute mesenteric ischemia.

D-dimer has been proposed as a reasonable rule-out test for acute
mesenteric ischemia.

\textbf{How about radiology studies?}

\uline{Plain film:}

Frequently normal, may show ileus in the early stages. In late stage
acute mesenteric ischemia, findings on plain film can include bowel wall
edema (thumbprinting) or pneumatosis.

\uline{CT angio:}

Probably represents the most common diagnostic modality to diagnose
acute mesenteric ischemia. CTA has the advantages of speed,
availability, and noninvasiveness when compared to conventional
angiography, and also allows for some assessment of the degree of bowel
involvement.~

Preferentially, a ``negative'' oral contrast agent would help prevent oral
contrast from causing artifact or obscuring evaluation of the vessels,
although the availability of these agents may limit their use.

\textbf{How about mesenteric duplex (vascular lab studies)?}

Mesenteric duplex has the advantage of being able to see the velocity of
flow across a stenosis, giving you a good method of quantifying the
significance of a stenosis. However, bowel gas often limits the acoustic
windows for visualizing the mesenteric arteries, and so we usually will
have patients fast for several hours before a study. Also, duplex is
more sensitive for proximal disease rather than distal mesenteric
involvement. For these reasons, mesenteric duplex is considered the gold
standard for evaluating chronic mesenteric ischemia, but has no real
role in the evaluation of acute mesenteric ischemia. Can you imagine,
having a tech mash a transducer into a patient with acute abdominal
pain?\uline{!}~

\hypertarget{management-23}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-23}}

\textbf{What's your approach to the initial management of the patient?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \uline{Resuscitation}. Fluids, fluids, fluids. These patients
  are really volume down, and are headed towards a profound
  distributive shock that will be worsened by your eventual plan for
  revascularization (think ischemia-reperfusion injury). Also look for
  electrolyte imbalances and correct those early.
\item
  \uline{Antibiotics}. These patients are not usually septic on
  initial presentation, but are at high-risk, so broad-spectrum
  antibiotics with gut coverage (Gram negative and anaerobes) are
  standard of care.
\item
  \uline{Heparin}. In the absence of a clinical
  contraindication, these patients should be systemically heparinized,
  with a bolus, as soon as the diagnosis is made.~
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Which blood vessel does acute mesenteric ischemia typically involve?}

The SMA. This makes sense if you think of each mesenteric distribution.
The celiac distribution has organs that have redundant blood supply
(like liver and stomach). The IMA is frequently occluded in patients
with AAA, but the patients are rarely ever symptomatic due to collateral
flow. The hypogastrics (which ARE mesenteric vessels, especially in the
situation of an occluded IMA) principally supply the rectum from a
mesenteric standpoint.

For embolic pathology, the acute angle of the SMA seems to predispose it
to capture emboli from above, but this is more theoretical than proven.
The embolism is often lodged distal to middle colic
vessel.\citep{wyersmarkcandmartin133AcuteMesenteric2019, kazmersOperativeManagementAcute1998}

\textbf{Tell me about the two main pathologies, and how they would differ in
terms of the anatomy and operative findings.}

So the two most common etiologies of acute mesenteric ischemia are
embolism and thrombosis.~

Embolism is the more common, where preexisting thrombus (think atrial
fibrillation, mural thrombus from thoracic aneurysm, etc.) or plaques
from atherosclerotic disease break off and lodge in the SMA. The classic
operative finding is that an embolism lodges just distal to the middle
colic artery, where there is a significant caliber change in the SMA.
This is distal to the first few jejunal branches off of the SMA, leading
to the classic sparing of the proximal jejunum and transverse colon. In
other words, the mid to distal jejunum and all of the ileum will be
ischemic, but other areas of the SMA territory are spared.
Atherosclerotic debris is typically smaller, and results in smaller,
more patchy areas of ischemia.

Thrombosis occurs primarily as a plaque rupture of preexisting
atherosclerotic disease, resulting in acute thrombosis at the site of
the disease. Thus the patients will often present with an
acute-on-chronic symptomatology, having classic symptoms of postprandial
abdominal pain, food fear, and weight loss, but with a sudden onset of
severe symptoms. This frequently allows for the development of
mesenteric collaterals, which may make the onset of acute symptoms more
insidious than for embolic pathology. In the majority of situations, the
atherosclerotic disease is most severe right at the origin (consistent
with what we know about shear stress and branch points in blood
vessels). This means that when the plaque ruptures, the entirety of the
SMA occludes, leading to ischemia of the entire territory, as opposed to
the jejunal-sparing distribution seen in embolic disease.

\textbf{Describe the operative steps to getting exposure of the supraceliac
aorta (or the celiac artery).}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Divide triangular ligament to mobilize left lobe of liver
\item
  Divide gastrohepatic ligament to enter the lesser sac~
\item
  Retract liver to right with a self-retaining retractor
\item
  Push esophagus left (use NGT to assist with identification)
\item
  Divide peritoneum overlying crura to identify celiac vessels
\item
  Typically trace common hepatic artery backwards to identify celiac
  artery

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Watch out for the left gastric vein as it crosses the celiac
    artery as it drains the lesser curve of the stomach into the
    portal vein.
  \item
    About half of the time, the phrenic artery takes an origin from
    the celiac artery and must be controlled during exposure.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  To expose the supraceliac aorta, divide the median arcuate ligament
  and separate the left and right crura from each other.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{So through this kind of exposure, what mesenteric vessels do you get
access to?}

You can trace most of the proximal celiac distribution right at the
origin, and through this exposure you get access to the origin of the
SMA if you mobilize the superior border of the pancreas. The neck of the
pancreas and the splenic vein cross the anterior of the SMA, obscuring
the rest of the mid and distal SMA from the superior approach.

\textbf{How about getting to the rest of the SMA?}

There are a couple of places you can get exposure to the SMA.~

Most commonly you'll hear it described at ``root of the mesentery.''
Specifically, lifting up the transverse colon will stretch out its
mesentery (i.e.~transverse mesocolon). At the bottom, or ``root'' of the
transverse mesocolon, a transverse incision is made. If the middle colic
artery is palpable in the mesocolon, the incision can be made around it,
and you can trace the middle colic backwards to the SMA. Usually you'll
find the SMV first, and the SMA will be just to the left of it. Be sure
to identify and preserve small jejunal branches during the dissection.
If needed, careful dissection superiorly, going behind the inferior
border of the pancreas can get a little more proximal exposure.
Embolectomy through a transverse arteriotomy in the SMA is the best
approach.\citep{wyersmarkcandmartin2019, kazmersOperativeManagementAcute1998}

Alternatively, you can get to the SMA from a lateral approach,
specifically from the left side. Begin by dividing the ligament of
Treitz and mobilizing the 4th portion of the duodenum. The SMA is found
in the tissues just cephalad to the duodenum. You can also improve your
proximal exposure if needed by retracting the inferior border of the
pancreas cephalad to the level of the left renal vein.

Other options include a retroperitoneal exposure, like you were
preparing to treat a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. Additionally, the more
distal SMA can just be identified in the small bowel mesentery.

\textbf{So for the operative strategy for acute mesenteric ischemia, tell me
about the general approach to the patient.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \uline{Resect frankly necrotic bowel and contain gross
  spillage}. Once you revascularize the bowel,
  compromised-appearing bowel may improve and not need immediate
  resection. Thus the first step is only damage control, to remove
  anything completely unsalvageable that is making the patient sick,
  or anything causing gross contamination of the operative field. The
  key is you're not doing anything definitive with the bowel as your
  first step.
\item
  \uline{Revascularization}. SMA embolectomy is the initial
  management of choice for embolic disease. Thrombotic disease, on the
  other hand, may be more challenging to treat by embolectomy alone,
  and frequently are treated with a bypass. (More to come on these
  procedures).
\item
  \uline{Re-assess bowel viability}. Clinical status permitting,
  20-30 minutes should be taken to fully assess the results of the
  revascularization before proceeding with resection. Perfusion can be
  assessed by many methods, including clinically, by Doppler, pulse
  oximetry (a.k.a. photoplethysmography), fluorescein fluorescence,
  etc. The take home is to give the bowel enough time to be perfused
  before going ahead with resection.
\item
  \uline{Proceed with temporizing or definitive bowel repair}.
  Resection, leaving in discontinuity, primary anastomosis, diversion,
  etc. All of these are options on the table, but the key here is that
  all of the previous steps occur before addressing the bowel.~
\item
  \uline{Consider second-look laparotomy.}~Many times, bowel may
  look questionable even after revascularization and thorough
  re-assessment. To preserve the most bowel length, it may be
  reasonable to leave borderline bowel alone at the index operation
  and do a ``second look'' to fully reassess the bowel, especially after
  the patient has benefitted from aggressive resuscitation in the ICU.
\end{enumerate}

Endovascular approaches to acute mesenteric ischemia have been described
but data is limited. Exploratory laparotomy and embolectomy should be
preferred management.\citep{wyersmarkcandmartin2019}

\textbf{Let's talk a little about the steps for an SMA embolectomy.}

Typically, you'll expose at the root of the transverse mesocolon. After
obtaining proximal and distal control, an arteriotomy is made, and
embolectomy can be performed by passing Fogarty catheters in both a
retrograde and antegrade fashion. The arteriotomy can be made
transversely for an embolectomy, and thus could be closed primarily. A
longitudinal arteriotomy may be advisable if you have a high suspicion
that you'll need to do a bypass, and if not, may be closed with vein
patch angioplasty (remember that the field is contaminated or dirty in
many situations).

\textbf{So if I'm gonna do a bypass, what are my options for conduit?}

Yeah, so again, because the field is frequently contaminated or dirty, a
good conduit is saphenous, followed by femoral vein. Thus every patient
undergoing surgery for acute mesenteric ischemia should have both legs
prepped out in the field. Prosthetic conduit has the advantages of being
more resistant to kinking (externally reinforced), likely better patency
than vein (although data are a little mixed), but in the situation of
gross contamination may be less preferred than vein. Other less common
options include cryo-preserved cadaveric homograft, or rifampin-soaked
prosthetic.

\textbf{And what are some of my options for constructing a bypass?}

\uline{Short retrograde aorto-SMA bypass:}

This bypass takes is origin off of the aorta just below the SMA,
anastomosing typically end-side onto the SMA just below its origin in
order to bypass ostial or very proximal disease. This is a relatively
quick bypass, with only one field of dissection directly from the aorta
below the SMA onto the proximal-mid SMA. The length of the bypass is
very short, limiting concerns with kinking or twisting of the bypass.
However, this may not always be feasible, as SMA disease often coexists
with significant aortic disease. Additionally, the other bypasses
described have better reported patency.

\uline{Long retrograde R iliac-SMA bypass (``C-loop''):}

This bypass originates from the right common iliac artery, which
presents a number of distinct advantages over an aorto-mesenteric
bypass. First, using the iliacs avoids the hemodynamic consequences of
an aortic cross-clamp, which may be contraindicated depending on your
patient's medical condition. Second, you can avoid showering, causing
dissection, or otherwise injuring your clamp sites if you have
significant disease in the mesenteric segment of the aorta, which is
common in patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia. The graft should be
tunneled in a gentle C-loop towards the SMA to avoid kinging or
twisting. The proximal anastomosis is performed end-side on the iliac
artery, and the distal can be performed either end-end or end-side
depending on the anatomy of the disease. Especially when using
prosthetic in a contaminated field, you can consider taking an omental
flap to wrap or cover the prosthetic.

\uline{Antegrade supraceliac aorta-SMA bypass:}

This bypass originates from the supraceliac aorta. If revascularization
of both celiac and SMA is planned, a bifurcated graft can be selected. A
side-biting aortic clamp can be used to mitigate the hemodynamic effect
of an aortic cross-clamp. The tunnel to the SMA is created with gentle
finger dissection in a retropancreatic plane, taking care to avoid
injury to the SMV.

\textbf{What other options have been described for treatment of acute
mesenteric ischemia?}

\uline{Retrograde open mesenteric stenting (ROMS)}

So ROMS is a hybrid procedure involving an upper midline laparotomy that
is used to evaluate the bowel. Through this incision, SMA exposure is
obtained just as in a traditional open fashion at the root of the
mesentery. The mid-SMA is then punctured under direct vision, and the
area of disease is attempted to be treated from a retrograde approach
back into the aorta. If bowel ischemia is found, the upper midline is
easily lengthened into a traditional vertical laparotomy incision.

\uline{Endovascular treatment (percutaneous thrombectomy / thrombolysis /
pharmacomechanical thrombectomy)}

Some authors have described completely endovascular approaches to
treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia. However, the major limitation is
the inability to assess the bowel. These patients are frequently those
who are deemed to be lower-risk for frank bowel ischemia or perforation,
but the rates of laparotomy and bowel resection after these treatments
have been described at over 20\%. Probably not your first answer for oral
boards.

\hypertarget{other-etiologies}{%
\subsection{Other Etiologies}\label{other-etiologies}}

\textbf{What are some other, more rare etiologies of acute mesenteric
ischemia?}

Embolism is the most common etiology of acute mesenteric ischemia
(40-50\%), and thrombotic etiology composes another quarter to a third of
these populations. The other two etiologies to consider are
non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia and mesenteric venous thrombosis.

\textbf{Perfect, so how does a non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (or NOMI)
patient differ from what we've been talking about?}

So NOMI patients typically do not have a focal lesion like you see with
embolism or thrombosis. What happens to these patients is that
classically they're pretty sick patients with some predisposing factors,
most commonly ESRD. On top of that, there was some clear inciting
hemodynamic event causing sustained hypotension, such as recently
getting a session of hemodialysis or undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.
The presentation is more indolent and less obvious than embolic or
thrombotic acute mesenteric ischemia, and the imaging findings are more
consistent with a diffuse vasospasm and hypovolemia picture.

Treatment is primarily conservative, with the emphasis on resuscitation
and addressing whatever the underlying etiology is. Adjuncts to this
include placement of infusion catheters into the affected vessel with
infusions of vasodilators (most commonly papaverine at 30-60mg/hr) or
prostaglandin \citep{wyersmarkcandmartin133AcuteMesenteric2019, trompeterNonocclusiveMesentericIschemia2002} NOMI with portal venous
gas, pneumatosis and free air often indicate need for laparotomy.

\textbf{How about mesenteric venous thrombosis?}

This is the most rare and most difficult to diagnose. They have a very
slow course, frequently with a lot of other workup already done. There's
a wide variety of causes that have been reported, and any of the things
that contribute to Virchow's triad have been reported (thrombophilia
from coagulopathy or malignancy, venous stasis from abdominal
hypertension or obesity, direct injury from trauma, surgery, or
inflammation). The diagnostic test of choice is a CT with portal vein
contrast, which most commonly identifies thrombosis in the superior
mesenteric vein (but can also involve the IMV, portal vein, or splenic
vein). The treatment of choice is therapeutic
anticoagulation.\citep{acosta2019}

\hypertarget{chronic-mesenteric-ischemia}{%
\section{Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia}\label{chronic-mesenteric-ischemia}}

\hypertarget{presentation-and-evaluation-1}{%
\subsection{Presentation and Evaluation}\label{presentation-and-evaluation-1}}

\textbf{How does chronic mesenteric ischemia differ in its presentation?}

Chronic mesenteric ischemia is characterized by post-prandial abdominal
pain, typically 30-60 minutes after eating (think after gastric emptying
time). This pain is usually severe, crampy, and resolves after minutes
to hours of time. The pain leads to food fear and eventual
\uline{unintentional} weight loss. The next step in evaluation in
these patients is a mesenteric duplex to evaluate for elevated
velocities.

However, the clinical presentation here is key. Chronic mesenteric
ischemia is pretty unlikely in patients who do not have this
constellation of clinical symptoms, and it's really common for patients
to be referred with imaging findings of elevated mesenteric velocities
on duplex who have none of the clinical findings, and thus do not
benefit from any intervention.

\textbf{What are the duplex criteria for chronic mesenteric ischemia?}

Yeah, so really the two vessels we're concerned with here are the celiac
artery and the SMA. It's pretty rare that stenosis of the IMA results in
clinically significant ischemia, and also pretty rare that isolated
disease of either the celiac or the SMA would be enough to cause
significant symptoms. Typically you see the classic symptomatology of
chronic mesenteric ischemia in patients with occlusive disease in both
the celiac and the SMA.

The key numbers to remember here are peak systolic velocities (that's
PSV) of 200 cm/s for the celiac artery, and 275 cm/s for the SMA. These
correspond to a stenosis of at least 70\%. Remember, the \textbf{superior}
mesenteric artery has \textbf{higher}~velocity criteria, in case you forget.
These classic numbers come from a study done in 1993, and many other
studies have demonstrated other thresholds. Make sure to check with your
friendly neighborhood vascular technician to see what the thresholds in
your local lab are!

In addition to the PSV, you can also use the end diastolic velocity
(EDV) to predict stenosis. For the EDV values in the celiac and the SMA,
think approximately 50 cm/s predicts a stenosis of 50\% (easy to
remember, \textbf{50-50}). This is known as Bowersox criteria, and is
actually \textgreater45, but 50 is easier to
remember.\citep{bowersoxDuplexUltrasonographyDiagnosis1991}

You can also predict a higher degree of stenosis with EDV values. This
is easy for the SMA, where an EDV of 70 cm/s predicts a stenosis of 70\%
(\textbf{70-70}). For the celiac, it's a bit higher, where an EDV of 100 cm/s
predicts that same 70\% stenosis.

So to review the numbers: \citep{monetaDuplexUltrasoundCriteria1991, monetaMesentericDuplexScanning1993, zwolakMesentericCeliacDuplex1998, aburahma2012}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  PSVs: 200 in the celiac or 275 in the SMA gives you 70\% stenosis
\item
  EDVs: 50s in the celiac or 50s in the SMA gives you 50\% stenosis
\item
  EDV \#2: 100 in the celiac, or 70 in the SMA gives you 70\% stenosis.
\end{itemize}

Final thought. When the celiac artery is severely narrowed or occluded,
often you'll have retrograde flow coming from the SMA via collaterals
(these are your pancreaticoduodenal arcades via the GDA). You can see
this as backwards flow in the common hepatic artery, and this has 100\%
specificity for disease in the celiac
artery.\citep{warnckeSuperiorMesentericArtery2019}

\hypertarget{management-24}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-24}}

\textbf{What's next in the approach to these patients?}

Frequently they're going to get some kind of axial imaging, either CTA
or MRA, to help plan for their revascularization, although this isn't
strictly necessary. Often endovascular approaches are the mainstay of
treatment. Remember that the angle of the SMA frequently favors a
brachial approach, although you can also engage the SMA from a femoral
approach with preformed catheters (think Sos, Cobra, etc) or steerable
sheaths. Remember to watch out for median nerve compression from
brachial sheath hematomas if you've opted for a percutaneous brachial
approach, with a low threshold to evacuate the hematoma and perform
median nerve decompression if the patient develops and symptoms in the
median nerve distribution postoperatively. Also remember that a brachial
sheath hematoma will not be easily palpable or visible at the skin
level, so the neurologic exam postoperatively is key.

Single vessel SMA revascularization is widely accepted for chronic
mesenteric ischemia without necessarily needing to revascularize the
celiac axis. \citep{oderich132ChronicMesenteric2019, foleyRevascularizationSuperiorMesenteric2000}

\textbf{Any other technical tips for endo intervention on the mesenterics?}

The best view for diagnostic angiography in mesenteric ischemia is the
lateral view.

Most often balloon-expandable stents are selected for the mesenteric
circulation. The precision of deployment and the increased hoop strength
of a balloon expandable stent make them more favorable here over the
radial force of a self-expanding stent. You can also flare the proximal
end of a balloon-expandable stent into the aorta, making sure that
you've really treated any ostial disease. Some authors advocate for use
of embolic protection devices to prevent distal embolism, and other
authors also advocate for the use of covered stents for the mesenteric
circulation due to better patency.\citep{oderichComparisonCoveredStents2013, oderich132ChronicMesenteric2019}

\textbf{What is the surveillance protocol for an SMA stent?}

At most institutions it is 1mo, 6mo and annually
thereafter.\citep{mohler2012, zierler2018}

\textbf{How about open revascularization?}

In most centers, up to 80\% of CMI is treated endovascularly. Open is
often reserved for those that fail endovascular
therapy.\citep{oderichOpenSurgicalTreatment2010, oderich132ChronicMesenteric2019}

So we talked a lot about open revascularization earlier in the acute
mesenteric ischemia segment. The techniques are broadly similar, with
the exception that often for chronic mesenteric ischemia, frequently
you'll be planning to revascularize both the celiac and the SMA. The
approach for this is with a bifurcated graft from the supraceliac aorta,
taking one limb down to the celiac artery, and the other limb tunneled
in a retropancreatic fashion to the mid-SMA. Remember that this approach
requires a supraceliac aortic cross clamp, which your patient may not be
able to tolerate. But single revascularization of SMA is often
acceptable with appropriate collaterals. Taking a retrograde bypass off
of the common iliac artery as we previously described may be a better
option for patients with significant comorbidities. A further option
that completely avoids a bypass is to go right for a trapdoor
endarterectomy of the celiac artery and the SMA, allowing you to address
coral reef or proximal/ostial disease (such as flush occlusions) that
are difficult to treat endovascularly.~

If symptomatic, most SMA aneurysms are mycotic in nature and require
treatment. Treat with resection and saphenous vein interposition and 6
weeks antibiotic therapy based on intraoperative
cultures.\citep{leeInfectedMycoticAneurysms2008}

Asymptomatic aneurysms can be observed up to
2.5cm.\citep{kwong85SplanchnicArtery, stoneSuperiorMesentericArtery2002}

Post splenic aneurysm embolization, L flank pain in stable patients

patients.\citep{kwong85SplanchnicArtery, piffarettiSplenicArteryAneurysms2007, zhuEndovascularSurgicalManagement2019}

Splenic artery embolization also an effective way to treat
thrombocytopenia, particularly chemo induced, when splenectomy is too
high risk.\citep{bhatia2015}

\hypertarget{median-arcuate-ligament-syndrome-mals}{%
\section{Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS)}\label{median-arcuate-ligament-syndrome-mals}}

\textbf{Can you tell me about median arcuate ligament syndrome and how that
differs from chronic mesenteric ischemia?}

Sure, so median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS), which has many names
(Dunbar syndrome, celiac axis compression syndrome, etc.) is a somewhat
controversial entity that occurs when repeated compression of the celiac
artery occurs against the median arcuate ligament during respiratory
variation. The thing you want to visualize here is that during full
exhalation, the lungs are completely emptied, and the diaphragm moves up
at a sharper angle. This angulation kinks off the celiac artery more
severely, so velocities in \textbf{exhalation} are \textbf{higher} in MALS.
However, these findings are common in asymptomatic patients, and so just
like chronic mesenteric ischemia, the clinical presentation is key.
They'll have a similar presentation as chronic mesenteric ischemia
patients, with post-prandial pain, food fear, and weight loss, but often
the symptomatology is a little more indolent in these patients. Because
of this, these patients have frequently gotten the million dollar workup
for nonspecific GI pain. Duplex ultrasound of shows celiac PSV \textgreater200 and
EDV \textgreater50, normalizes during deep inspiration, and post-stenotic spectral
broadening.\citep{zwolakMesentericCeliacDuplex1998}

The treatment of choice for suspected MALS is a laparoscopic median
arcuate ligament release, frequently performed by a MIS/foregut surgeon.
A key point here is that you don't want to be fooled into putting a
stent in these patients before they've gotten their median arcuate
ligament release, because the dynamic motion of the diaphragm is likely
to crimp or bend the stent if that hasn't been treated yet. It may be
that some patients benefit from endovascular treatment after release,
though, as some think that the chronic damage from MALS can result in
intimal damage/scarring that persists even after the extrinsic
compression is treated by the median arcuate ligament release.

\hypertarget{sma-syndrome}{%
\section{SMA Syndrome}\label{sma-syndrome}}

\textbf{What is SMA syndrome?}

So SMA syndrome, also called Wilkie's Syndrome is a rare entity where
the 3rd portion of the duodenum gets compressed between the SMA and the
aorta, causing a functional gastric outlet obstruction. Patients are
typically emaciated, having lost a significant amount of weight before
their symptom onset. What's happened is they've lost the retroperitoneal
fat pat that normally surrounds the SMA, and so the angle between the
SMA and the aorta becomes more acute, pinching off the duodenum.

Classic findings in fluoroscopic swallow in SMA syndrome are delayed
gastric emptying, a dilated duodenum, to and fro peristalsis in the
proximal duodenum and cutoff in the third portion. EGD can show
pulsation in the 3rd portion of the
duodenum.\citep{warnckeSuperiorMesentericArtery2019}

The treatment of choice here is enteral feeding with a nasojejunal tube
or other surgically placed tube and TPN, because what really will help
them here is weight gain. GJ bypass or duodenal mobilization is
sometimes needed for treatment, but is controversial. It's not really a
mesenteric vascular disease, but it sometimes shows up on exams as a
related entity.\citep{welschRecallingSuperiorMesenteric2007, merrettSuperiorMesentericArtery2009}

\hypertarget{uterine-fibroids}{%
\section{Uterine Fibroids}\label{uterine-fibroids}}

Symptomatic uterine fibroids are now often treated with uterine artery

embolization (UAE), but may only need unilateral if blood supply is
unilateral. Infarcted tissue can be expelled or become infected even
years after initial embolization.

\textbf{What is renovascular hypertension?}

Hypertension as a result of progressive renal artery stenosis

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  While renal artery stenosis is a relatively common finding in older
  patients with hypertension, it's relatively uncommon as the primary
  cause of hypertension.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is ischemic nephropathy?}

Decreased renal function and/or chronic kidney disease that results from
atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis due to a reduction in glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) and rise in creatinine produced by any cause of
diminished renal blood flow. Primary mechanism is chronic hypoperfusion.
\citep{rickey125RenovascularDisease2019}

\textbf{Who is at risk for ischemic nephropathy?}

Renal injury can develop in anyone with a kidney or kidney region beyond
a critically stenotic artery

Now, this is usually in patients with atherosclerotic disease, but any
flow limiting lesion---such as coarctation of the aorta, mid-aortic
syndrome, or fibromuscular dyplasia-- can cause ischemic neuropathy OR
renovascular hypertension.

In terms of clinical practice, the prevalence of renovascular
hypertension is probably less than 1 \% in patients with mild
hypertension but may be as high as 10 to 40 \% in patients with acute
(even if superimposed on a preexisting elevation in blood pressure),
severe, or refractory hypertension.

\textbf{That's the best you can do, 10-40\%? That's a big window.}

Yes, and it illustrates the biggest issue we have with renovascular
disease. We know 5-22 \% of patients 50 years or older who have advanced
CKD have some degree of renal artery stenosis and 23 to 54\% of these
patients have bilateral renal artery disease.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Bilateral renal arterial stenosis is associated with more widespread
  atherosclerotic disease, higher serum creatinine levels, and higher
  mortality than unilateral disease
\item
  Renal artery revascularization among patients in these studies
  infrequently produced a meaningful recovery of kidney function,
  which would have supported the diagnosis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So not everyone with flow limitations to their renal vascular will get
renovascular hypertension or ischemic nephropathy?}

Not at all, actually. Flow limiting lesions may be an ``incidental''
finding in patients who have CKD or hypertension that is caused by a
separate disorder (eg, diabetic nephropathy and essential/primary
hypertension).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Because of this, it can be very difficult to distinguish between
  patient whose disease is induced by renal artery stenosis and those
  who have alternative causes of CKD or renovascular hypertension.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So you're telling me that we have no idea who has clinically
significant disease and who doesn't?}

No.~Fortunately there are clinical findings that suggest that
renovascular disease is an underlying cause:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recent or rapid development of severe hypertension.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Relatively specific for renovascular hypertension and is the
    strongest predictor of antihypertensive benefit from
    revascularization.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Severe hypertension that may be treatment resistant.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Some patients with ischemic nephropathy are normotensive, which
    may be due in part to a reduced cardiac output
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Acute rise in serum creatinine following the administration of
  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin
  receptor blockers (ARBs).

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Rise in serum creatinine is more common with agents that block
    the renin-angiotensin system than with other antihypertensive
    drugs because glomerular filtration rate (GFR) often depends
    upon the efferent arteriolar actions of angiotensin II in this
    setting.
  \item
    More common with bilateral as compared with unilateral disease
    because there is hemodynamic compromise to the entire renal
    functional mass
  \item
    This usually resolves after withdrawal of the drug.
  \item
    Restoring the renal blood supply in such cases can recover the
    ability to use these drugs for blood pressure control.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Significant variability of serum creatinine concentration that may
  be due to changes in volume status
\item
  A rapid rise in arterial pressure associated with sudden development
  of left ventricular failure (``flash pulmonary edema'').

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This finding is more common with renal artery stenosis because
    bilateral disease is also associated with diuretic resistance
    and sympathetic adrenergic activation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Deterioration of kidney function after placement of an endovascular
  aortic stent graft-- IATROGENIC

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    EVAR with isolated L renal coverage -\textgreater{} splenal renal bypass,
    ligate splenic artery distally and then perform end-to-end
    anastomosis to renal artery.
    \citep{benjamin126RenovascularDisease2019}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So it matters which kidney is affected or if it's one or both?}

Yes, effect of the stenosis may not be clinically apparent due to
compensatory function of the unaffected contralateral kidney

Most cases of renal artery stenosis affect one side much more than the
other; one kidney is affected with the second kidney being essentially
normal, hence the designation ``unilateral'' disease.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis, contralateral
  kidney is damaged by uncontrolled hypertension and circulating
  angiotensin II and aldosterone. \citep{rickey125RenovascularDisease2019}
\end{itemize}

Patients who are diagnosed with ischemic nephropathy usually have
high-grade stenosis of both renal arteries or stenosis to a solitary
functioning kidney.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is this subpopulation of the disease that merits specific
  consideration because of its additional contribution to fluid
  retention, loss of kidney function, and congestive heart failure.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are the pathophysiological mechanisms at play here?}

Like we said, first you need a flow limitation. We mentioned several,
but by in large There are two major causes of renal artery stenosis:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Atherosclerosis -- you'll generally see this in patients over 45
  years old, likely with known PVD/CAD---though it can occur as an
  isolated renal lesion---usually involving the aortic orifice or the
  proximal main renal artery.
\item
  Fibromuscular dysplasia -- These patients are most often women under
  the age of 50 years and typically involves the mid- or distal main
  renal artery or the intrarenal branches.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Rarely iatrogenic from malposition or migration of endovascular
    aortic stent grafts over the renal orifices.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Takayasu's arteritis - although a rare cause of renovascular
  hypertension, this is the most common presentation of Takayasu's
  arteritis (60\%). First line therapy is open revascularization.
  \citep{ehlert139TakayasuDisease2019, weaverRenalRevascularizationTakayasu2004, zhuTakayasuArteritisImaging2012}
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=13in]{images/renal1}

\textbf{I think the flow limitation part has been well established. What
next?}

Renal (especially bilateral) hypoperfusion induces activation of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which increases vascular tone and
impairs sodium excretion resulting in expansion of the extracellular
fluid volume.

\hypertarget{medical-management-and-evaluation}{%
\section{Medical Management and Evaluation}\label{medical-management-and-evaluation}}

\textbf{Can't we just treat their hypertension and give these patients an ACE
inhibitor at this point?}

Sure. And oftentimes we do. In fact, many of these patients can be
treated with medical therapy without loss of function or irreversible
fibrosis, sometimes for many years

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Studies in human subjects demonstrate that, despite a moderate
  reduction in renal perfusion pressure (up to 40 \%) and in renal
  blood flow (mean 30 \%), glomerular filtration is reduced but tissue
  oxygenation within the kidney cortex and medulla can adapt without
  the development of severe hypoxia.
\item
  But this only works to an extent.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Explain that\ldots{}}

As the hypertension is treated, we're lowering the pressure gradient
across the stenosis and can actually increase the degree of renal
malperfusion and worsen the renal function.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Oftentimes this loss of kidney function is a reversible consequence
  of antihypertensive therapy but it to some degree limits our ability
  to control the hypertension medically without causing further damage
  to the kidneys\ldots. And it can also reflect progressive narrowing of
  the renal arteries and/or progressive intrinsic kidney disease as
  more advanced vascular occlusion, corresponding to a 70 to 80\%
  narrowing of the renal artery, leads to demonstrable cortical
  hypoxia.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Can we tell who has cortical hypoxia through diagnostic tests?}

A: To some degree. Cortical perfusion can be measured by blood oxygen
level dependent magnetic resonance (BOLD-MR). Additionally, inflammatory
markers sampled from renal veins of stenotic kidneys correlated strongly
with the degree of hypoxia (as measured by BOLD-MR), particularly after
correction of the stenosis with angioplasty

\textbf{So we have a patient with evidence of malperfused kidneys, either
through worsening renal function or uncontrolled hypertension, with
known discrete stenoses, and we even got a BOLD-MRI which confirms it.
Let's just revascularize them and be done with it?}

Not so fast. Although vascular stenosis or occlusion can initiate these
processes, long-standing ischemia causes parenchymal injury
characterized by inflammation and fibrosis which eventually becomes an
irreversible process. At some point, restoring renal blood flow provides
no recovery of kidney function or clinical benefit.

\textbf{So how can we determine who has CKD or hypertension due to
renovascular stenosis that we can actually help?}

This is probably the most important question since in this whole disease
process.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To start, if a patient has the clinical manifestations of ischemic
  nephropathy or renovascular hypertension as we discussed above, a
  presumptive diagnosis of ischemic nephropathy can be made if there
  is radiologic documentation of significant stenosis (usually more
  than 70 \% luminal occlusion) of both renal arteries or of one renal
  artery to a solitary functioning kidney.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{But how do we know the vascular occlusive disease posing critical
hemodynamic limitation to kidney function?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Generally, luminal occlusion of at least 60 to 75 \% is required to
  limit blood flow and reduce perfusion pressure
\item
  This degree of stenosis is usually associated with a measurable
  translesional ``pull-back'' pressure gradient of 10 to 15 mmHg.
\item
  Doppler ultrasound criteria \citep{hoffmannRoleDuplexScanning1991, zierlerStrandnessDuplexScanning2016}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Peak systolic velocities above \textgreater170 cm/sec with post stenotic
    turbulence to identify less than 60 \% luminal stenosis.
  \item
    Renal aortic ratio \textgreater3.5 required to diagnose greater than 60\%
    stenosis.
  \item
    Elevated velocities can be seen with tortuosity, but this should
    be able to be confirmed with B-mode.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Identifiable levels of cortical hypoxia (measured by blood oxygen
  level dependent magnetic resonance BOLD-MR) are usually associated
  with translesional velocities above 385 cm/sec or reduction of
  single kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the range of 20 to
  25 mL/min.
\item
  MRA can be used for evaluation

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Pro - no radiation, good imaging of distal renal arteries, no
    degradation from ostial calcium.
  \item
    Cons - requires GAD -\textgreater{} interstitial fibrosis in CKD
    {[}@galanNephrogenicSystemicFibrosis{]} and degrades with motion
    and respiration
    \citep{nelsonGadoliniumenhancedBreathholdThreedimensional1999}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Most importantly: is the condition of the kidneys such that restoring
renal blood flow is likely to benefit function?}

Short answer, we still can't be certain.

Long answer, we can at least have some idea by considering the renal
resistive index, the six-month trajectory of kidney function, and the
size of the kidneys or by performing a kidney biopsy (which is not
usually done).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  None of these factors predict the outcome of revascularization with
  certainty.
\item
  \uline{Improved and validated methods to evaluate the salvageability of
  kidney function in this disorder are greatly needed and are the holy
  grail of this disease process.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Let's go through some of these:}

\uline{Renal Resistive index:}

Some studies indicate that elevated resistive indices in segmental
vessels (above 0.80) measured by duplex ultrasound denote poor prognosis
for renal recovery while a low resistive index is a favorable sign.

\uline{Trajectory of kidney function}

The most consistent predictor of good recovery of kidney function after
revascularization has been a recent deterioration of kidney function
(ie, in the prior six to twelve months). Similarly recent progression of
hypertension is a sign of likely good recovery.

\uline{Kidney size}

Very small kidneys (less than 8 cm in longest diameter) are usually
considered unlikely to recover after revascularization.

\uline{Kidney biopsy}

Previous studies suggest that biopsy demonstrating preexisting
atheroembolic changes and interstitial fibrosis indicate a limited
potential for recovery.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Biopsies are not usually performed.
\end{itemize}

\uline{Comparison of kidney morphology with kidney function}

Some investigators have recommended assessing morphologic parameters,
such as renal parenchymal volume and cortical thickness with MRI, and
comparing these parameters with kidney function measured by radionuclide
scanning

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In a stenotic kidney, apparently normal morphology combined with
  reduced function may indicate a ``hibernating kidney'' that could be
  salvaged with revascularization.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So how do we get a definitive diagnosis?}

A definitive diagnosis is not usually made before revascularization. In
practice, confirmation of the diagnosis is based upon stabilization or
improvement of the GFR after successful revascularization.

\hypertarget{operative-managment}{%
\section{Operative Managment}\label{operative-managment}}

\textbf{Now we think our patient's renal artery stenosis maybe is causing
hypertension or decline in renal function and we can possibly reverse
it\ldots{} how do we treat it?}

For starters, all of these patients should receive medical therapy to
control their hypertension in addition to routine CKD care and
surveillance. They need to be aggressively treated for secondary
prevention of cardiovascular morbidity with aspirin, statins, cessation
of smoking, and, in patients with diabetes, glycemic control.

\textbf{Second, once diagnosis has been made we have 2 therapeutic
alternatives\ldots{} Which are?}

First, medical therapy alone- this generally involves ACE-I or ARB and
as we discussed.

RAS can worsen ACE-I and ARB induced renal dysfunction due to systemic
hypotension, efferent arterial vasodilation, and reduced glomerular
hydrostatic pressure, in turn lowering GFR.
{[}\citep{rickey125RenovascularDisease2019, schoolwerthRenalConsiderationsAngiotensin2001}{]}

\textbf{Okay, in other words we can have chronic normalization of the systemic
pressure that might eventually lead to ischemic atrophy due to the
reduced renal perfusion pressure distal to the stenosis? Any other
concerns with medical management alone?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We're addressing or prevention progression of stenosis in those with
  atherosclerotic disease.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Since this isn't a vascular medicine podcast, what's our other
option?}

Procedural intervention (open or endovascular) along with medical
therapy.

\textbf{Now you're talking. Who should we fix operatively?}

Some but not all patients should undergo revascularization, Patient
selection single most important factor.

Depends upon the hemodynamic severity and likely recoverability of
kidney function

\textbf{You mentioned recoverability before, can you once again touch on some
recoverability indicators?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A short duration of blood pressure elevation prior to the diagnosis
  of renovascular disease, since this is the strongest clinical
  predictor of a fall in blood pressure after renal revascularization
\item
  Failure of optimal medical therapy to control the blood pressure
\item
  Intolerance to optimal medical therapy (eg, deterioration of renal
  function during antihypertensive drug therapy)
\item
  Recurrent flash pulmonary edema and/or refractory heart failure
\item
  Otherwise unexplained progressive renal insufficiency, particularly
  if proteinuria is absent
\item
  CKD stage 3a and 3b most likely to benefit from revascularization.
  \citep{singerImpactBaselineRenal2009}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Lower GFR likely to progress to ESRD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Degree of stenosis, age, pre-procedure BP control and meds are not
  assocaited with improvement.
  \citep{textorPercutaneousRevascularizationIschemic2013}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{But do we have any good data proving our interventions help?}

This is where things can get muddy.

Early on, observational studies demonstrated a high rate of procedural
success with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) and
stent placement (\textasciitilde85\%) in patients with ostial atherosclerotic disease,
as well as a high rate of clinical success measured by improvements in
blood pressure and kidney function in 50 to 75 \% of subjects.

\textbf{Anything better than observational studies?}

Unfortunately, randomized trials showed no additional benefit from
stenting when added to medical therapy with respect to blood pressure
control, renal function, cardiovascular events, and mortality. But these
studies have their own limitations.

\textbf{The one we keep hearing about is the CORAL trial. Tell me about
that.}

  \item

    myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, a
    reduction in eGFR by more than 30 \%, or end-stage renal disease)
    as compared with medical therapy alone (35.1 versus 35.8 \%).

      Total occlusions and ostial lesions extending into aorta
      generally do not respond well to angioplasty alone due to
      elastic recoil.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Quick results: maximum antihypertensive response is generally
    observed at 48 hours after the procedure

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      But BP levels and antihypertensive drug requirements often
      change over subsequent weeks
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    In general, the effects of revascularization on blood pressure
    were greater in bilateral disease, but effects on renal function
    and mortality did not differ in those with bilateral as compared
    with unilateral stenosis .
  \item
    Most atherosclerotic lesions are now treated with primary
    stenting to avoid rapid development of restenosis.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      A higher initial primary success rate, defined as less than
      50 \% stenosis (88 versus 57 \%).
    \item
      At six months, a higher patency rate (75 versus 29 \%) and a
      lower restenosis rate (14 versus 48 \%).
    \item
      Twelve patients assigned to PTRA alone underwent stenting
      because of treatment failure within six months. These
      patients had a similar blood pressure response as those
      initially treated with stenting.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Performing a renal angiogram
    \citep{edwards127RenovascularDisease2019}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
    \item
      Supine with arms overhead or straight out to the sides
    \item
      LAO 15-20deg
    \item
      Flush catheter placed just above the renals
    \item
      Breath hold, high frame rate and non-DSA due unavoidable
      patient movement
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What about complications?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Complication rate with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty
  with or without stenting is between 5 and 15 \%

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Mostly minor: puncture site hematoma and renal artery
    dissection.
  \item
    Serious complications more rare: renal artery thrombosis or
    perforation, AKI 2/2 atheroembolic disease (\textasciitilde1\%)or
    radiocontrast agent injury.
  \item
    Mortality exceedingly rare
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Outcomes data}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the correct patient population:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Unilateral disease

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      PTRA alone results in normalization of blood pressure
      (removal of antihypertensive drug therapy) \textasciitilde8-20\%
    \item
      Some improvement 50-60\%
    \item
      Failure rate \textasciitilde20-30\%
    \item
      Restenosis rate of 8 to 30 \% at two years (without stent)
    \item
      Better results with unilateral fibromuscular disease.
    \item
      Less consistent for patients with chronic hypertension
      compared with patients who have an acute elevation in blood
      pressure
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Bilateral disease

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      25-30\% will recover kidney function to a meaningful degree,
      sometimes avoiding progression to end-stage kidney disease
      (ESKD) and/or the need for renal replacement therapy.
    \item
      \textasciitilde50\% will have little immediate change in kidney function
      but will ``stabilize''
    \item
      \textasciitilde20\% will have a progressive deterioration of kidney
      function, sometimes related to the procedure
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  2005 ACC/AHA guidelines on peripheral artery disease recommends that
  a stent be placed in patients undergoing PTRA for treatment of
  atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis \citep{hirschACCAHA20052006}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    PTRA without stent placement is rarely performed unless the
    anatomy precludes stenting.
  \item
    POBA without stenting is generally less successful and
    associated with more complications (eg atheroemboli)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How durable is PTA/stenting?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Restenosis

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textasciitilde11-17\%

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      11-39\% during the first one to two years
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Detected as a rise in blood pressure requiring more intensive
    therapy
  \item
    Angioplasty/stenting injures the vascular endothelium, which may
    result in restenosis.
  \item
    Symptomatic stenosis leading to a rise in blood pressure or a
    fall in GFR are less common and are reported in 10 to 20 \% of
    patients
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How do you follow these patients after stenting?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Follow-up of patients who have had a renal artery stent should
  include serial measurements of blood pressure and estimation of GFR.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Post-stent duplex ultrasound @2-4weeks with
  \item
    Repeated examinations on a quarterly basis (not much data)
  \item
    Patients who develop an increase in pressure or reduced GFR
    after stenting should undergo duplex ultrasonography to identify
    restenosis
  \item
    Retreatment with angioplasty with or without repeat stenting can
    be attempted, but the restenosis rate after repeat angioplasty
    is increased.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Surgical reconstruction may be pursued in patients with
      recurrent episodes of restenosis and loss of kidney
      function.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{open-surgery}{%
\subsection{Open Surgery}\label{open-surgery}}

\textbf{What about an open operation?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \uline{Surgical revascularization} used in addition to medical
  therapy

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Less common since the widespread application of effective
    antihypertensive drug therapy and endovascular stents (mid 90s)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So who still gets open repair?} \citep{benjamin126RenovascularDisease2019}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Younger patients
\item
  Unfavorable anatomy (i.e.~occlusion or branch disease)
\item
  Failures of endovascular therapy (i.e.~in stent restenosis)
\item
  Need for concomittent aortic revascularization.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How do we do it?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Involves bypassing the stenotic segment or of removing a small
  atrophic kidney with nearly complete arterial occlusion.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    From the aorta or hepatorenal or splenorenal bypass to avoid
    diseased aorta.
  \item
    Bilateral: either bilateral repair or unilateral repair with
    contralateral nephrectomy of a nonfunctioning, atrophic kidney.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Bilateral ostial disease in a young patient can be treated with
  transverse arteriotomy and bilateral renal endarterectomy. Close
  primarily or with PTFE/polyester patch. Second line is bilateral
  bypass with GVS. \citep{benjamin126RenovascularDisease2019}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How do outcomes compare to PTA/stenting?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Equally or more effective than PTRA in the treatment of
  atherosclerotic disease, with cure of or improvement in the
  hypertension occurring in 80 to 95 \% of patients.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Cure of hypertension after surgery is most likely in patients
    who have been hypertensive for less than five years
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Lack of complete response was usually associated with one of two
  factors:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Presence of underlying primary/essential hypertension
  \item
    Development of intrarenal vascular disease due to exposure of
    the contralateral kidney to the elevated blood pressure.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guidelines recommendations?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  2005 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
  (ACC/AHA) guidelines \citep{hirschACCAHA20052006}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Open surgery in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery
    stenosis largely restricted to those who have multiple small
    renal arteries, have early primary branching of the main renal
    artery, require aortic reconstruction near the renal arteries
    for other indications (eg, aneurysm repair or severe aortoiliac
    occlusive disease), or to avoid manipulation of a highly
    diseased aorta or failed endovascular stents (using specific
    surgical techniques, including splenorenal, ileorenal, or
    hepatorenal bypass procedures).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So why not do it instead of stent?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In-hospital mortality: \textasciitilde3-10 \% in high volume centers

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Risk factors diffuse atherosclerosis, advanced age, chronic
    kidney disease, heart failure, or chronic lung disease.
  \item
    No deaths in 105 procedures for fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{fibromuscular-dysplasia-fmd}{%
\section{Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD)}\label{fibromuscular-dysplasia-fmd}}

\textbf{You mentioned FMD as a cause of renovascular hypertension, tell me
more about that\ldots{}}

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic
disorder that leads to arterial stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm,
dissection, and arterial tortuosity.\citep{olin2011}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Virtually always diagnosed radiographically -- formerly
  pathologically, but rarely sent for specimen in modern diagnosis or
  treatment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How do we classify it?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Most commonly classified by angiographic appearance:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Multifocal FMD (more common)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      angiographic appearance of a ``string of beads.''
    \item
      corresponds pathologically to medial fibroplasia, the most
      common histologic type, and to perimedial fibroplasia, which
      is less common.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Focal FMD (less common)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      angiographic appearance of a ``circumferential or tubular
      stenosis''
    \item
      corresponds pathologically to intimal fibroplasia but medial
      hyperplasia and periarterial hyperplasia may also have a
      focal appearance.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    These two different angiographic subtypes of FMD (multifocal and
    focal) have different phenotypic presentations and natural
    history

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Is FMD is, in fact, a single disease?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Where does it occur?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Has been observed in nearly every arterial bed
\item
  Involvement of the renal arteries \textasciitilde75-80\%
\item
  Involvement of the extracranial cerebrovascular arteries (eg,
  carotid and vertebral arteries) \textasciitilde75\%

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    2/3 of patients have multiple arteries involved.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Who has FMD?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textasciitilde90\% of cases in adults are in women.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No female predominance among children with FMD.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Mean age at diagnosis was 52 years, with a range of 5 to 86 years

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In the past, it was believed that FMD was a disease of young
    women. However, older now know to make up a large proportion of
    affected
  \end{itemize}
\item
  35-50\% of cases in children and 5-10\% of cases in adults under the
  age of 60 years with renovascular hypertension
\item
  Often an incidental finding:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    4.4\% of potential kidney donors had evidence of FMD.
  \item
    CORAL trial:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      FMD was discovered in 5.7\% of the total study population
      (8.8\% of enrolled females)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What causes FMD?}

The exact etiology of FMD remains unknown, but some mechanisms have been
proposed

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Most often results from medial fibroplasia (60-90\% of cases).
  Collagen deposits in the media result in elastic fibrils and
  fibromuscular ridges. \citep{olinFibromuscularDysplasiaState2014}
\item
  'Genetics may play an important role in development

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Some studies report autosomal mode of inheritance with variable
    penetrance
  \item
    Potential association with a single nucleotide variant in the
    phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1)
  \item
    Variant rs9349379 is also a risk locus for coronary artery
    disease, migraine headache, and cervical artery dissection.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Predominance of young/childbearing age women hormonal influences are
  thought to play a role

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Remains unproven.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Mechanical factors such as stretch and trauma unproven.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Does FMD present differently that the atherosclerotic renovascular
disease we talked about?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Varies widely depending on artery affected and as it results from:
\item
  Ischemia related to stenosis
\item
  Dissection and occlusion of major arteries (renal infarction,
  stroke, myocardial infarction)
\item
  Rupture of aneurysms
\item
  Embolization of intravascular thrombi from dissection or aneurysms
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are the common presenting symptoms and signs}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Manifestations of renal FMD (eg, hypertension, flank pain) are more
  likely to occur in men, as are arterial dissections and aneurysms.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Most common presenting signs:
  \item
    Hypertension -- 67\% (66\% of women and 74 \% of men)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  But overall hypertension is the most common manifestation of renal
  artery FMD in both genders

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Flank pain and abdominal pain can result from ischemia, aneurysm
    rupture, or dissection of renal and mesenteric arteries,
    respectively.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Are these dissections common?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  High prevalence of aneurysm and/or dissection

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Aneurysm (22\%) and dissection (26\%).

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      34\% of aneurysms were renal
    \item
      11\% of dissections were renal
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    42\% had an aneurysm and/or dissection.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So should we screen for these dissections in a patient with known
FMD?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Every patient diagnosed with FMD should have one-time,
  head-to-pelvic CTA (or MRA) is an alternative.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    CTA of the neck and head on one day followed one week later by
    CTA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{When should we suspect FMD?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hypertension (particularly in a woman under the age of 60 years)
  with findings that would prompt an evaluation for secondary
  hypertension:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Severe or resistant hypertension.
  \item
    Onset of hypertension before the age of 35 years.
  \item
    A sudden rise in blood pressure over a previously stable
    baseline.
  \item
    A significant increase in the serum creatinine concentration
    after the institution of therapy with an angiotensin-converting
    enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in
    the absence of an excessive reduction in blood pressure.
  \item
    An epigastric/abdominal bruit.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Renal artery dissection (or carotid, vertebral, coronary)
\item
  Aneurysm in a visceral, carotid, vertebral, or intracranial vessel.
\item
  Renal infarction.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How do we diagnose this and/or distinguish it from renovascular
atherosclerotic disease?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Confirmed by diagnostic imaging that reveals consistent findings
\item
  Noninvasive imaging test is usually performed first. This includes
  CTA, MRA, and Duplex ultrasound.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Let talk about CTA\ldots{}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CTA is preferable due to higher spatial resolution than MRA, less
  dependence upon technical expertise, and a shorter scan time
\item
  Excellent diagnostic accuracy for FMD of the main renal arteries,
  although the sensitivity decreases when FMD is only present in the
  smaller branch renal arteries.
\item
  Multirow detector CT scanners, which offer more rapid image
  acquisition, variable section thickness, three-dimensional
  rendering, diminished helical artifacts, and smaller contrast
  requirements, may gain an increased role in the diagnosis and
  follow-up of renal artery FMD
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What about MRA?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Inconsistent detection of FMD and is performed if CTA is
  contraindicated
\item
  The spatial resolution in the branch vessels is not adequate, and
  artifact may occur, suggesting ``beading'' when none is present.
\item
  May miss mild FMD.
\item
  Can be useful for detecting aneurysms and dissections - can be
  difficult to diagnose on duplex ultrasonography.\citep{renaud2012}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{And finally, Duplex ultrasonography}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Detects elevated blood flow velocities in the mid and distal
  portions of the renal artery, most common locations for FMD.
\item
  Increased peak systolic velocity, turbulent blood flow, and
  tortuosity of the mid and distal artery.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \% diameter stenosis reports less helpful and usually inaccurate
  \end{itemize}
\item
  lowest spatial resolution of all of the cross-sectional imaging
  modalities
\item
  most operator dependence
\item
  first choice only in high-volume centers with extensive expertise in
  this technique
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What about non invasive testing?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  DSA is performed in patients if there is a high clinical suspicion
  of FMD, and treatment with revascularization is planned if a
  stenosis is found.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Can improve visualization of the arteries by eliminating
    background soft tissue and bone and has higher spatial
    resolution than any of the other imaging modalities
  \item
    Can measure the pressure gradient across the stenosis

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Pressure decrease threshold of 10 \% or more of the mean
      pressure should be used to decide whether a lesion is
      hemodynamically significant
    \item
      IVUS and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be helpful
      in determining if a dissection or intramural hematoma is
      present as well as help to determine if angioplasty has
      improved the stenosis.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Negative DSA excludes a diagnosis of FMD in the vascular bed
    that was imaged.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Any place for pathologic diagnosis in modern therapy?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Histopathology (and histologic classification) is \textbf{no longer} part
  of the diagnosis.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Only in the rare patient who requires surgical revascularization
    or resection of an aneurysm.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So how do we treat this, what warrants intervention and are those
interventions different than what we offer atherosclerotic disease of
the renal arteries?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  All patients with FMD should be placed on antiplatelet therapy (ASA)
  unless otherwise contraindicated
\item
  \uline{Antihypertensive therapy}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Most patients will require antihypertensive therapy, even if
    they undergo revascularization.
  \item
    Majority of patients with \textbf{focal} FMD have their blood
    pressure cured with angoplasty
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{But what about revascularization?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \uline{Revascularization} Goal: control of hypertension

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    BP can be controlled in most adults with multifocal FMD with a
    mean of two antihypertensive medications
  \item
    Weigh risks and benefits in well controlled hypertension.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{No} randomized trials comparing revascularization with medical
  therapy
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Well then who do we treat?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recent-onset hypertension, with goal to cure hypertension.
\item
  Resistant hypertension despite compliance with an appropriate
  three-drug regimen.
\item
  Patients unable to tolerate antihypertensive medications or who are
  noncompliant with their medication regimen.
\item
  Adults with bilateral renal FMD, or unilateral renal FMD to a single
  functioning kidney, and unexplained progressive renal insufficiency
  thought to result from renal artery stenosis
\item
  Hypertensive children.
\item
  may be at higher risk than adults for progressive renal parenchymal
  loss, and therefore could benefit from revascularization even if
  their hypertension can be well-controlled with one or two
  antihypertensive medications.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{And what kind of results do we get with revascularization?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hypertension is cured or improved following revascularization in a
  large proportion of patients with FMD.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Much better than 2/2 atherosclerosis
  \item
    Varies considerably from study to study, although hypertension
    control improves in most patients and depends in large part upon
    the definition of cure.
  \item
    Not good data on stabilization of either GFR or renal size in
    patients with FMD.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

What options do we have in terms of revascularization?

\textbf{Angioplasty and open surgery}

Do we have good results treating FMD with these?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Patients most often treated with angioplasty alone with good
  success. \citep{daviesLongtermOutcomesPercutaneous2008, jenkinsOutcomesHypertensivePatients2015}
\item
  Improvement in blood pressure (including those with and without
  cure) was similar with PTA as compared with surgery (86 versus 88
  \%).
\item
  Older age and longer duration of hypertension prior to
  revascularization were significantly associated with a lower cure
  rate.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How do these compare?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  PTA achieves similar technical success and is associated with a
  lower risk of adverse events in observational studies
\item
  Most patients with FMD who are selected for renal revascularization
  have PTA rather than surgery
\item
  Major adverse events were more frequent with surgery (15 versus 6
  \%).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So why choose open surgery?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cure rates were higher with surgery (54 versus 36 \%).
\item
  Surgery rather than PTA if PTA fails or if the arterial anatomy is
  not amenable to PTA

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Patients with small renal arteries (\textless4 mm), with branch renal
    artery disease, or with extensive intimal fibroplasia.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So how do we perform Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty} for FMD?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \uline{Without} stent placement\ldots{} unlike PTA for
  atherosclerotic RAS
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why not place a stent?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Patients do very well with angioplasty alone, no reason to place a
  stent.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Lesion is so fibrotic that the pressure gradient cannot be
    obliterated with an angioplasty, a stent will not correct this
    problem

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Such patients should be referred for surgery.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Usually have stenoses in the mid and distal portions of the artery
  rather than at the ostium or proximal portion (as occurs with
  atherosclerosis).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Should surgical revascularization become necessary due, for
    example, to in-stent restenosis, patients may require more
    complex branch repair to bypass the occluded stent since the
    stent often covers the renal artery up to the point of the first
    intrarenal branch.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Do we ever place stents?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Stents placed when a dissection results from the performance of PTA
  or in the rare instance in which a perforation of the renal artery
  occurs during angioplasty.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{And we're getting good outcomes with PTA alone?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Technical (angiographic) success rates for PTA 83-100
\item
  Rate of restenosis 12-34\% over follow-up intervals of six months to
  two years

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Difficult to determine if patients with FMD develop restenosis,
    or if the lesion was not completely treated correctly the first
    time.
  \item
    Not necessarily associated with recurrent hypertension.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{But generally we can achieve significant and sustained reductions in
systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, and
number of antihypertensive agents.}

\textbf{What should we do if it doesn't work?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If either has no improvement in blood pressure or an initial
  improvement followed by recurrence, repeat angiogram and PTA.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Restenosis may actually represent inadequate angioplasty during
    the first procedure
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Persistent HTN despite technically successful PTA suggests that the
  cause of hypertension is unrelated to fibromuscular disease or is
  related to small vessel disease within the kidney (nephrosclerosis)
  due to longstanding hypertension.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What kind of complications do we see after this?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pediatric patients: hypogastric artery grafts are used or else
  aortic reimplantation of the renal artery is performed because vein
  grafts become aneurysmal
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How does this compare again to PTA?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Similar success rates compared to PTA (82-89\% patency) but with
  higher morbidity.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Perioperative mortality appears to be very low (\textasciitilde1.2\%)
  \item
    Usually limited to complex cases so success and complication
    would probably be higher if simpler cases were included.

\textbf{What's Monitoring and follow-up look like for these patients?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Medical management only:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Renal artery stenosis and kidney dysfunction may progress
    despite good blood pressure control

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Mostly in patients with focal FMD and intimal fibroplasia
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Every patient with FMD should have measurement of serum
    creatinine and renal artery duplex ultrasound every 12 months.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{And After revascularization}?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Duplex ultrasonography and serum creatinine measurements performed
  on the first office visit post procedure, then every six months for
  two years, and then yearly, if stable.
\item
  With worsening on new hypertension, or unexplained increase in the
  serum creatinine, he or she should be imaged at that time with
  duplex ultrasound (or CTA if the ultrasound is equivocal or poor
  quality).

  Renal artery aneurysms are rare - Autopsy studies have revealed an

\item
  Females \textgreater{} males, although females = males with FMD excluded
\item
  Although arteriosclerotic changes have been identified in most
  aneurysms in patients with multiple lesions, this is not a uniform
  finding, suggesting that arteriosclerosis may not be the most
  important factor in the genesis of renal artery aneurysms.
\item
  More likely due to a congenital medial degenerative process with
  weakness of the elastic lamina.
\item
  Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is often a direct contributor to the
  development of an aneurysm.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Medial fibroplasia is typically associated with multiple
    stenoses and post-stenotic dilatation of the distal two thirds
    of the renal artery.
  \item
    Renal artery aneurysms in association with FMD are generally
    only a few millimeters in diameter.
  \item
    The typical angiographic appearance of a renal artery involved
    with medial fibroplasia is a ``string of beads.''

\hypertarget{demographics-4}{%
\subsection{Demographics}\label{demographics-4}}

\textbf{What is an aortic dissection?}

It's when a tear occurs in the intima that results in separation of
layers of the intima and media and allows blood to flow through the
false lumen.

\textbf{How common are they and how serious are they?}

Acute dissections occur around 3/100000 - 2-3x more common than ruptured
aortic aneurysm. For Type A dissections, early mortality 1-2\% per hour -
if untreated, 20\% die within 6 hours, 50\% within 24 hours, 70\% first
week.

Main cause of death in type A is aortic rupture into the pericardium,
acute aortic regurgitation, and coronary ostia compromise. While
patients with descending thoracic aortic dissections are more likely to
die from end organ compromise due to obstruction of visceral or
extremity vessels in the acute phase of the disease.

\textbf{The time frame is also important.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hyperacute \textless24 hours
\item
  Acute \textless{} 2 weeks
\item
  Subacute 2 weeks -- 3 months -\textgreater{} TEVAR
\item
  Chronic \textgreater3 months -\textgreater{} Chronic aneurysmal degeneration/ partial
  false lumen thrombosis (highest risk) = operative treatment
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{classification-and-terminology}{%
\subsubsection{Classification and Terminology}\label{classification-and-terminology}}

\textbf{When we think about aortic dissections there are a few
classifications, how can we break it down?}

Historically, there are the Stanford and Debakey Criteria.

Anatomical Stanford

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Type A - involves the ascending aorta, 2/3 (most common)
\item
  Type B - arises from distal to L subclavian, 1/3
\end{itemize}

Debakey

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    1 - ascending + descending
  \item
    2 - ascending only
  \end{itemize}
\item
  B - distal or at the LSCA.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    3a - Descending aorta above diaphragm
  \item
    3b - Descending aorta above and below diaphragm
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How about the new system proposed by Dr Lombardi, the SVS-STS
classification system?}

The new system published in 2020 keeps A and B and adds a number system
which divides the aorta into zones from 0 proximaly to 12 distally in
the mid SFA. \citep{lombardiSocietyVascularSurgery2020}

\includegraphics[width=13.06in]{images/thoracic_dissection1}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Type A is now JUST the ascending aorta to the innominate, also
  called Zone 0.
\item
  Type B is now an entry tear in Zone 1 or greater and distally to
  whichever zone the dissection lands in.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{penetrating-aortic-ulcer-and-intramural-hematoma}{%
\paragraph{Penetrating Aortic Ulcer and Intramural Hematoma}\label{penetrating-aortic-ulcer-and-intramural-hematoma}}

\textbf{This anatomical classification is based on reading the CT angio. What
else could we see on a CT angio that we have to know about?}

So aside from the aortic dissection its self, you could see a bleb of
contrast sticking out. That could be an \textbf{penetrating aortic ulcer}.
That is an atherosclerotic plaque that penetrates the internal elastic
lamina of the aortic wall.\citep{ciccone2016}

Another key finding can be an \textbf{intramural hematoma} which is a
hyper-dense crescent shaped hemorrhage within the aortic wall. There is
no identifiable direct communication between the true and false lumen.
IMH are classified in the same way but with the abbreviation IMH p-d
zones.

\includegraphics[width=13.06in]{images/thoracic_dissection2}

\textbf{Whats the significance of these two in combination?}

There is a higher chance of aortic rupture if a penetrating aortic ulcer
is seen with intramural hematoma.

\textbf{When a patient presents with an aortic dissection how can we classify
them clinically?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Uncomplicated

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Stable hemodynamics
  \item
    No evidence of malperfusion
  \item
    Pain controlled
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Complicated

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    End organ ischemia / malperfusjon
  \item
    Rupture or impending rupture
  \end{itemize}
\item
  High risk for early complication or continued
  growth\citep{vanbogerijen2014, reutersberg2018}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Uncontrollable pain / hypertension
  \item
    Bloody pleural effusion
  \item
    Aortic diameter \textgreater40mm / False lumen diameter \textgreater{} 22mm
  \item
    Readmission
  \item
    Radiographic only malperfusion
  \item
    Entry tear on the lesser curve
  \item
    Number vessels originating from false lumen and length of
    dissection.\citep{brunkwall2014, kamman2017, nienaber2009}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the danger of a false lumen? How does it lead to symptoms and
malperfusion? Likewise which arteries commonly branch off the true
lumen?}

The false lumen can lead to end organ ischemia as the intimal flap can
cover the ostia of branching vessels. This can be a static or a dynamic
obstruction.

Likewise it also leads to weakening in the wall of the aorta which can
become a threatened rupture or rupture if the diameter of the false
lumen is larger than 22mm.

The celiac trunk, SMA, right renal typically come of the true lumen.
Left renal comes off the false.

Also the dissection most commonly goes down into the left common iliac
rather than the right. You might be able to detect down stream effects
of this on clinical exam with reduced left sided groin pulse.

The presence of multiple false lumens is associated with increased risk
of aortic dissection related death.\citep{sueyoshi2013}

\textbf{What kind of patients get aortic dissections?}

Hypertension (older patients) / cocaine or Meth (younger patients)

Marfans, Loeys-Dietz, Ehlers Danlos Type 4, Turners, arteritis, Bicuspid
aortic valve.

We also have a traumatic cause of aortic dissections. That being called
blunt thoracic aortic injury:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Grade 1: intima tear
\item
  Grade 2: IMH
\item
  Grade 3: Pseudo aneurysm
\item
  Grade 4: Aortic rupture.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{presentation-11}{%
\subsubsection{Presentation}\label{presentation-11}}

\textbf{How do these patients present?}

Signs and symptoms -- Chest pain 90\% tearing pain radiating between the
shoulder blades.

Chest pain extending to the abdomen abdomen? Think mesenteric ischemia
or aortic tear

Type A - Stroke 5-10\%,Syncope 15\%, tamponade, carotid dissection,
paralysis.

Others: MI -- Hypovolemic shock -- leg ischemia

\hypertarget{evaluation-16}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-16}}

\textbf{What is the workup?}

Physical Exam --Asymmetric pulses / blood pressure differences /
Diastolic murmur,

Investigations - CXR, EKG, D-dimer + Troponin, CTA, ECHO for type A.

The big distinction is to find out if this is a type A or type B because
the treatment strategy is completely different.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Type A need an emergent operation
\item
  Type B starts with medical management, follow up CT angiogram +/-
  Trans esophageal echo in the OR. Reevaluate at 24 hours.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{management-27}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-27}}

\textbf{What are the details of Type A treatment?}

Operative treatment. 30\% op mortality. Cardiothoracics take the lead on
this one. However vascular surgeons should be involved in the management
of type A as after the repair, a type A can become a functional type B.

Type B is in the realm of vascular surgery. What is the first management
step after we have diagnosed a type B dissection?

Invasive impulse therapy. That means redusing the force of transmitted
impulse down the aorta. Blood pressure goals of 100-120mmHg. Hr \textless{}
60bpm.

\textbf{How would you achieve that?}

Start with a beta-blocker (esmolol or labetalol) first then a
vasodilator (nitroprusside). This is to stop the sympathetic surge after
vasodilation that could increase pressure and thus tearing forces inside
the aorta worsening the dissection.

Initial CT, 72 hours, 3 months x 4, q6 months x2, q12 month. (Descending
thoracic aorta that dilates first.)

\textbf{Why isn't open surgery indicated for type B dissections?}

Open surgery is not recommended due to the high mortality 30\% if \textless{} 48
hours. 18\% if \textgreater{} 49 hours.

In the acute setting mortality can be up to 50\% with a 20\% paraplegia
risk. Its been described as sowing tissue paper.

\textbf{What is the management plan for a complicated Type B aortic
dissection?}

Start with invasive medical management and plan for TEVAR. The goal with
TEVAR being to direct the blood flow into the true lumen and seal the
entry tear. If there was a dynamic obstruction (flap occludes branching
vessels.) Then TEVAR would reestablish the true lumen hence removing the
dynamic obstruction. Endovascular fenestration can also equalise the
pressure in the true and false lumen. \citep{lombardiSTABLEIIClinical2020}

For a static occlusion there could be a thrombus or stenosis in the
branched vessel so a stent might be indicated.

\textbf{What are the major risks of TEVAR in the management of Type B aortic
dissections?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Retrograde type A (reported 2\% in literature however it can be
  around 20\% in some experiences). Carries a high mortality (ranging
  from 7-50\%). Factors associated with retrograde dissection include:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Over-sized endograft - every 1\% over 9\% results in an increase
    in retrograde dissection of 14\%.\citep{canaud2014}
  \item
    Proximal landing zone more than 40mm (2\% -\textgreater{} 18\%)
  \item
    Periprocedural hypertension
  \item
    Underlying aortopathy.\citep{tjaden2018}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Paraplegia (reported around 5\%)
\item
  Stent induced new entry.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Is there a role for TEVAR in uncomplicated type B dissections?}

The INSTEAD and INSTEAD XL trials looked at uncomplicated Type B
dissections. There was NO statistical difference at 2 years comparing
OMT vs TEVAR but at 5 years there was good aortic remodeling and better
long term survival in patients treated in the sub-acute stage.

Timing for TEVAR is a difficult choice. In chronic dissections the
septum thickens leading to a potentially difficult TEVAR. Anecdotally,
TEVAR is best at 2 weeks to 3 months.

It should be noted, that both the thoracic and abdominal aorta often
continue to dilate even after repair so follow up surveillance is
paramount.\citep{famularo2017}

If repair must extend into Zone 2, then pre-TEVAR carotid subclavian
bypass should seriously be considered in elective/urgent inpatient
setting to reduce the risk of periprocedural stroke (1.9\% vs
14.3\%).\citep{bradshaw2017, teixeira2017} Revascularization of the L
subclavian with a L subclavian bypass is particularly important with a
LIMA CAMB or a dominant L vertebral and a transposition is not
appropriate.\citep{morasch2009, matsumura2009}

Jenkins

\hypertarget{anatomy-and-demographics}{%
\subsection{Anatomy and Demographics}\label{anatomy-and-demographics}}

\textbf{Can you take us through the Crawford classification to start off?}

The Crawford classification is relatively recent, to be honest it was
1986.\citep{crawford1986} And I think it was really important because it's
very practical classification, depending on body cavity and how to get
to an aneurysm. It's a bit old in terms of anatomy because they don't
really follow a pattern one would expect going one to four would be
getting either more extensive or less extensive. And it's not quite like
that.

So type one is from the left subclavian down to just below the
diaphragm. And that's crucial because that distinguishes it from a
thoracic aneurysm, which you can get to just from the chest and from a
practical surgical approach. That's a very important differentiating
marker, but you have to go into a second cavity.

Type two is the biggie. So this is from the left subclavian all the way
down to your bifurcation. So both abdominal and thoracic exposure, all
the visceral, renal arteries and a lot of intercostal and lumbers. So
big impact for cord supply, et cetera.

So three is for mid chest down to and involving the viscera, renals, and
bifurcation. And that's the one, which really is I suppose, the
differentiator between whether you go for the full support that's needed
in a type two, or whether you can risk a clamp and go approach.

And type four is characterized by being in most patients accessible from
the abdomen. I say in most patients, because there are some anatomical
situations with body habitus, which means that going into the left chest
is useful even for type four aneurysm.

Then type five. It was an additional classification that came in later,
which is a bit like a type three at the top of the type one at the
bottom effectively, but not everyone uses that.

\textbf{There appears to have been an increase in the incidence of
thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Do you think it's a true increase or does
this relate to having scans for other reasons picked up by accident and
then going on from that? What sort of many referrals do you get in a
year and what's your turn down?} \textbf{How many numbers are you actually
doing in your practice year on year?}

So that's interesting because the overall incidence of infrarenal
atherosclerotic aneurysms is going down every year in the national UK
vascular registry. And I suppose that is a legacy of the end of smoking
for a big group of patients. I think thoracoabdominal aneurysms are
going up partly because we are now imaging more and more people. and
therefore we are imaging the chest and seeing them, which perhaps wasn't
the case, previously. So that's an artificial increase in incidence, but
also the rate of aortic dissection is on the rise, s chronic post
dissection aneurysms are increasing. I think it's a small group, but
there is more knowledge about connective tissue disease and genetic
studies and family screening, which perhaps is also a small part of
annual increase. So over the next, 10, 20 years, certainly aneurysms are
not going to go away. And that group of patients that have been affected
are still around and there is a huge number now within the national UK
screening program under surveillance for small animism, so it will come
to fruition.

\hypertarget{etiology-9}{%
\subsubsection{Etiology}\label{etiology-9}}

\textbf{You've just touched on a bit of difference in the etiology between
thoracoabdominal aneurysms and abdominal aortic aneurysm. So is there a
huge difference in the etiology between these two type of aneurysm from
your experience?}

On presentation, the majority of aneurysms are asymptomatic. So they're
found incidentally. It is rare that you get a symptomatic aneurysm. Some
can get tender as they approach a time when the wall is going to breach
pre rupture. I think thoracoabdominal aneurysms tend to be a bit more
symptomatic than infrarenal. These are ones that go into the arch and
present with hoarseness from recurrent laryngeal tension or bronchial
compression.

There is a group that cause dilatation of the crus-\/-I've seen, the crus
of the diaphragm acts like an extrinsic wrap and it can be extremely
tight at that point. These patients present with excruciating pain,
radiating around their cost al margin. This is tension on the crus and
it's often not thought of as a sign of of an aneurysm, but I think in
that group, it is. The larger the extent of aneurysm, things like weight
loss and general poor health begins to become increasingly seen in that
group with chronic aneurysms. So there are some subtle differences.

The other group that tends to occur, not in infrarenal aneurysms, is the
post dissection aneurysms and the majority of those are known about. But
there was a time when type A dissections, as in Stanford type one, which
went all the way down were only monitored really with echo and the
ascending. The rest was forgotten about, they got lost from
cardiothoracic follow up. That group is a different group because we
already know they've got an aneurysm. So there are subtle differences.

And then the connective tissue group, I suppose, is a bit different
because they tend to have more extensive aneurysms rather than just
confined to the infrarenal segment, which is by far and way, the most
common for abdominal aneurysms.

\textbf{So you've mentioned a few different etiologies. Moving on to
specifically thoracic aneurysms, you said a quarter of these are
associated with dissection in the past, and a small portion will have
underlying connective tissue disease. Do you think these patients will
have a different threshold for intervention compared to the
non-connective tissue disorder patients?}

I think we need to be aware that the connective tissue disorders we talk
about---Marfan's, Loeys Dietz, vascular Ehlers Danlos---are probably the
tip of the iceberg of a number of other cases that we don't have genetic
sequencing for, but behave differently. The data from a dimention point
of view is not quite as robust as one would hope, but the threshold that
most people would agree for non connective tissue disorders would be
about six centimeters. That takes into account the increased risks of
operating both in the chest and the abdominal segment.

I think most people would agree that five centimeters is a better cutoff
for connective tissue patients. Some cardiac surgeons would repair a
young Marfan ascending aneurysm at four and a half centimeters. It does
vary a little bit geographically, a bit like the threshold for
infrarenal aneurysms, which varies between Europe, the States and the
UK. So you've got to look at the patient in front of you and make a
decision. I would certainly increase the threshold for someone who was
not so fit and perhaps lower it a bit for a younger patient.

Also, be aware if it's something odd anatomically---a saccular bulge,
something where you think there could be a mycotic element---those are
all very different you can't be reassured by a dimension in an axial
plane that is safe. These findings up the ante, in terms of whether you
would pair at an earlier threshold. I'd include there a blowout for an
eccentric penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) or anything like that, which is
not a conventional fusiform aneurysm.

\textbf{Can you talk us through the Ishimaru zones of the aorta and why do we
need to know about these?}

Ishimaru was one of those useful classifications, there's lots of
classifications in medicine, but it's nice to find one that's actually
got a use. This classification made sure that everyone was on the same
page when reporting seals zones for thoracic devices. That is important
for two reasons. 1) the extent of coverage and 2) the complications
increased, the more proximally you go. The main complication for that is
stroke. So historically, Ishimaru decided to classify these zones.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Zone 0}, the first most proximal zone, is the ascending aorta up
  to and including the brachiocephalic trunk
\item
  \textbf{Zone 1} is between the brachiocephalic trunk and including the
  left common carotid artery
\item
  \textbf{Zone 2} is between the left common carotid artery and including
  the left subclavian artery
\item
  \textbf{Zone 3} is the aortic segment just distal to the left subclavian
  artery.
\item
  \textbf{Zone 4}, added by some people, is distal to the T4 level, which
  is much lower down the thoracic aorta
\end{itemize}

Most thoracic stenting will go really to zone three or perhaps into zone
two. The more proximal you go, the more work needs to be done in terms
of either extra anatomical debranching or using some form of fenestrated
or branched arch device with an increase in stroke risk. What this
allowed people to do is compare different series. You're not just saying
these were a group of TIVA patients, but you could define exactly how
proximally they go.

And the same applies for the Crawford classification. It allows
comparison within thoracoabdominal groups, and that's important with
both survival and complication rates. Because if your series is mainly
extent 2 thoracoabdominal aneurysms, you're going to have a very
different outcomes from someone who's got mainly type four aneurysms.
Both classifications allow you to look at and compare data between
groups.

\subsection{Management}\label{management-28}}

\hypertarget{ascending-aorta-and-arch}{%
\subsubsection{Ascending aorta and arch}\label{ascending-aorta-and-arch}}

\textbf{So if a patient has a thoracic aneurysm that affects their ascending
aorta, we obviously involve the cardiac surgeons. The patient may
require an elephant trunk procedure prior to intervention on the
descending aorta. Can you briefly summarize the difference between a
conventional elephant trunk and a frozen elephant trunk, and when to use
one over the other?}

This is particularly pertinent to aortic dissection. The the main
purpose of repair in Type A dissection is to protect the heart. People
die of either rupture into pericardium causing tamponade or stripping
the coronary ostia off and getting myocardial ischemia. So the priority
of repair in acute ascending aortic dissection is primarily to protect
the heart and to some extent for ensure a true lumen flow distally.
Therefore, it was very popular because it was the least invasive to do a
short interposition ascending repair, but that really left problems for
later.

Therefore, as people became more adept with cardiac and cerebral
protection, it became more popular to do a more extensive repair in the
first sitting. This involves an arch repair and an acceptance that
eventually the descending thoracic aorta will still need to be repaired,
but at a later stage. Now you have to be aware that the ascending and
arch is done from a median sternotomy, and it's really difficult to get
beyond the left subclavian form that position.

So when the arch was done, it was felt that the elephant trunk came from
leaving an extra piece of dacron within the descending thoracic aorta in
the true lumen of a dissection or in the main lumen of an aneurysm by a
double sewing technique on the distal anastomosis and an inverting it.
It would be left free and perfused in the descending, thoracic aorta.
The benefit of that was when one came back to then do the descending
thoracic segment via left thoracotomy, you could very quickly open the
aorta and clamp that Dacron for a ready, made proximal anastomosis,
which was much easier. It meant you didn't have to grow up and dissect
to the left subclavian with scar tissue and a previous anastomosis.

Now, what industry realized is that they could help with this procedure
by actually facilitating a device which had three or four branches on a
piece of Dacron, which was sized to be an arch replacement. There were
ready-sewn 10 millimeter branches with an extra pipe for rewarming.
These could then be sewn to be a innominate, carotid and subclavian and
attached to that piece of Dacron was then a stent graft, which could
then be placed distally in lieu of what was previously a floppy piece of
Dacron.

And two manufacturers, JOTEC and Terumo Aortic, have made these devices,
which facilitate and make things much easier. Therefore, so-called FET
or frozen elephant trunk, has now become quite popular. I don't quite
know why it's called frozen, but I think it perhaps means that the
thoracic segment is stiff with a supported stent graft rather than just
a floppy Dacron segment.

\hypertarget{isolated-thoracic-aneurysms}{%
\subsubsection{Isolated Thoracic Aneurysms}\label{isolated-thoracic-aneurysms}}

\textbf{So if we look at it at the isolated thoracic aneurysm, can you tell us
briefly about the principle of TEVAR and what's the optimal landing
zone. Finally, in your opinion, is rapid ventricular pacing required
when deploying these stents?}

So I think the isolated, thoracic aneurysm is a perfect application for
TEVAR because it fulfills all those minimally invasive credentials---an
endoluminal approach and if you can get a good seal zone, proximally and
distally, it saves a thoracotomy and it's a massive difference for the
patients. Unfortunately I suppose those cartoons you see on the industry
advertisements are vanishingly rare, when you've got a perfect proximal
and distal landing zone and have really straight thoracic aorta.

I think for the majority of cases, you need a 2cm seal zone proximally
and distally. However, if you have a torturous aorta, you likely need a
longer seal zone. You want to land in an area where there is a good
parallel walled walled segment. You have to be careful of so-called
``bird-beaking'' when a stiff, less conformable device lands perfectly on
the outer curve, but holds off on the inner curve. This resultsin a lip,
which protrudes and allows blood to get under that and cause stent graft
crushing. I think modern devices have become much more conformable.
We've learned the lessons of oversizing and the problems associated with
oversizing. We've learned how to taper stent grafts when there's
mismatch between proximal and distal landing zones.

These have all significantly improved things, but there's still no
getting away from the fact that some anatomy is not well adjusted to the
currently available stent grafts and Gothic arches are a particular
problem. I've already mentioned torturous and large sacks, which allow a
stent graft to move away from the center line to the outter
curve.\citep{iwakoshi2019} If that sac doesn't shrink, you can imagine that
draws on both the proximal and distal seals zone, and reduces them.

I think you can sometimes get away with a shorter landing zone. If, for
example, you're doing a post traumatic aneurysm where it's only on one
segment of the outer wall where there's a problem. But for the vast
majority of true aneurysms, you need that seal zone and you do need to
oversize to achieve that.

You can go more proximally, and I think the majority of aneurysms at the
left subclavian area, you can just drop the blood pressure to a systolic
of 70 or 80 pharmacologically. Once you go more proximal to that,
especially if you've got a custom device, with a scallop or branched
device where you need an absolutely critical landing zone, you then
really need to achieve a short transient period of circulatory arrest,
either with adenosine, which is perhaps sometimes a bit unreliable, or
rapid pacing.

Rapid Pacing can be difficult and does come with complications though,
such as ventricular puncture. There are some newer techniques in terms
of caval occlusion balloons, which basically stop venous blood returning
to the heart with a reduction in output. Those are gaining popularity
certainly in Germany and they can be quite effective for that. I think
having tip capture on devices and better, more accurate deployment and
better imaging does allow you to be more accurate in deployment, but
there are still problems.

These devices have been inserted to very torturous iliac systems
sometimes and they retain some energy. When you deliver them by removing
that sheath, sometimes that energy is still there and they can jump
forward as well as back. This can cause problems because you end up
covering a vessel that you didn't intend to.

\textbf{So you've just explained in detail that TEVAR is a great option for
the majority of cases, but I presume you still believe there is a place
for open repair in isolated, thoracic aneurysms, and why?}

I'm not so sure in isolated, thoracic aneurysms, unless for some reason
they're not suitable for TEVAR. I think if you've got problems with a
mycotic aneurysm or a fistula into the bronchus or esophagus, these are
our big problems with high mortality and your duty bound to go for open
repair.

Patients with hemoptysis and a previous aortic repair should carry a
high suspicion for an aortobronchial fistula. TEVAR is considered
preferred repair, due to high morbidity and mortality with open repair.
Bronchoscopy should be avoided due to high risk of
rebleeding.\citep{bailey2011, léobon2002, quintana2006}

Certainly with connective tissue patients, open has advantages. In some
unique situations it is possible to bridge between repairs. I think in
some of the younger connective tissue patients, they will end up having
certain segments repaired at different stages of their life. Although
it's probably now accepted that ``all endovascular'' is not a good option
for these patients, if you've got Dacron proximally and distally
already, bridging those segments with an endovascular device might work
well. Although the Dacron will slowly dilate, it won't dilate as much as
aortic tissue in these patients. So there are options, but I think in
reality, isolated, thoracic aneurysms on reasonable rare and TEVAR can
be used for the majority of them.

\hypertarget{thoracoabdominal-aneurysms}{%
\subsubsection{Thoracoabdominal Aneurysms}\label{thoracoabdominal-aneurysms}}

\textbf{Moving on to thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Earlier we used the Crawford
classification to describe the anatomical extent of the thoracoabdominal
aneurysm. So let's talk firstly, about type 1, 2, 3, and 5, which
involved the thoracic of water to a greater or lesser extent as well as
the abdominal aorta. We'll come back to type four later on in this
podcast.}

\textbf{So type 2 open thoracoabdominal aneurysm is arguably the most invasive
operation a patient can undergo and carries 30 day mortality in excess
of 10 to 15\%. What is the size threshold for type two that you currently
use in your practice and what is the evidence for this?}

So, as I suggested earlier, the evidence is that it's a bit historical,
and most people would actually say about six centimeters. I think that
can be brought down a little bit for connective tissue patients and can
go up a little bit for atheromatous patients. But in general, you're
talking about a younger segment of patients. This is not an operation
for people in their eighties. Outcomes stratified by age greater than 50
found a higher rate of death, paraplegia, renal failure, cardiac
complications and length of stay.\citep{coselli2017} These patients need to
be in very good shape because it is a big onslaught physiologically on
them. It's not just getting them off the table, it's getting them out of
intensive care and out of hospital and to recover back to their
baseline.

I think that's one of the things that can be really difficult about this
disease. You are taking patients who are effectively functioning quite
well, and they're often relatively asymptomatic and you're putting them
through a prophylactic operation to try and prevent rupture, which no
one quite knows if or when it'll happen.

\textbf{So to that end, can you talk us through the decision making process
when you're assessing a patient with a thoracoabdominal aneurysm types
1, 2, 3, or 5?}

I think it is really dependent on anatomy, physiology, and the patient
in front of you. Unfortunately, it is a bit of a bespoke assessment for
an individual patient. So firstly, I think you have got to look at what
are the options for that patient, which goes from conservative to
endovascular, to open surgery.

The endovascular domain has changed hugely now with the increasing
availability of branched devices. When I started, there weren't custom
devices. There were some FEVAR devices just coming out, and we did use
long covered stents going through devices with TIVA above. However,
there wasn't the option for what we've now got from an endovascular
perspective.

So I think you've got to choose the patients that are either unsuitable
for endovascular, or are we really going to benefit from a durabililty
of an open approach. Those are the two big differences, and they are
differences. One, you're going for gold standard approach because you
think they're life expectancy warrants that. The other one is much
higher risk, because they haven't got another endovascular option. These
range from people with very tortuous anatomy, to difficult renal
arteries, such as early divisions, that make them unsuitable as target
vessels. Another reason is complex dissections, which are not suitable
for an endovascular approach. Therefore, it is quite variable, but the
first thing you must consider is whether this patient is going to get
through this and get out of hospital. And that really is looking at them
in the eye and considering what's their quality of life or what's their
family support, and are they up for this?

The second one then is anatomical difficulties--- Is there a shaggy
aorta, atheromatous disease, or calcification of a target vessel, etc.
Severe aortic wall thrombus is associated with solid organ infarction
(24\%), acute kidney injury, without dialysis (21\%) and dealayed oral
intake by 3.4d, however rarely resulted in mortality
(0.5\%).\citep{ribeiro2017} Rarely is this a hundred percent or 0\% decision,
but it's about building up relative contraindications. Some of them are
pretty simple, like access problems for endovascular, and it's a
combination of those which then will sway you in one way or the other.
And if anything, that decision-making is probably more pertinent for
type three and type four, where there really is a different option and
these patients are n their sixties and seventies with classic
atheromatous disease. The really, young fit non-connective tissue
patient with a type 2 TAAA is a rare beast.

\textbf{For connective tissue disease, many textbooks prefer an open approach
over an endovascular approach do you still agree with this?}

Yes, I do. I think certainly, what were you know about patients who've
had total endovascular approaches for connective tissue diseases is that
they don't last. They may last five years or so and then you get
progressive aortic dilatation and loss of those of seal zones. Whether
that is the natural history of the native disease or whether it is
regional force hooks, barbs or whatever is related to the device is
unclear.

But when you sew these pensions and just touching the back end of a
needle on the anterior wall can create a massive problem or just being a
little bit clumsy and you get a radial tear. It's very clear that a
stiff device sitting in those aortas for many years with 60-70 beats per
minute going through it and often hypertension, isn't going last.

However there are some caveats, as I mentioned earlier, bridging between
previous prosthetic open repairs is a possibility. And sometimes in a
lifesaving situation, such as when someone has presented with a rupture,
you may have to use an endovascular approach. However, be prepared then
to treat that as a bridge and go back to do a definitive repair when
things have calmed down and in the cold light of day.

\textbf{So we don't really have the scope to dive into complex endovascular
repair in this episode, but can you describe the broad principles of
your operative approach to open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, type
two, because it's the most extensive?}

In terms of the patient, for anything juxtarenal or type four, I tend to
have a patient supine on their back, but with a break in the table at
the level between the costal margin and the anterior superior iliac
spine. Breaking the table at that level, you can massively increase the
exposure to that segment.

However, there are some patients even with a type four repair that
demand a left thoracoabdominal incion. For a type four, if you're doing
a left thoracoabdominal approach, it's usually for someone with a very
narrow acute angle of the costal margin, such as a more petite frame
female patient or a crus that is very high on the aorta. And if you look
at CT scans, which is something I've realized over many years, that not
everyone is the same. So where the celiac and SMA are can be in a
different proportion, depending on where the costal margin and and
skeleton is, which can make them easier or hard to get to. And certainly
in a situation, if there is a rupture within the left side of the
abdomen, you wouldn't really want to go into that without getting
proximal control. Because as you do the viceral rotation, you could have
catastrophic bleeding.

So under those circumstances, I'd also go into the left chest with a
reasonably low segment so that you can place a clamp ready before doing
the visceral rotation. So for type four the one above then, the higher
you go, the higher your thoracotomy and the more tipped over you need
the patient. So for a type two, you're going probably fifth intercostal
space and the shoulders are at 90 degrees and the pelvis is 60 degrees.
For type three, you're slightly further over, so you're down to about 60
degrees and you're perhaps in the seventh intercostal space. So the
lower you go, then right up to being pretty much supine.

The left arm is put over top. You mark the scapular and you go into the
chest and abdomen. I tend to go intraperitonealy into the abdomen, so I
can see the bowel, although there are people who do a retroperitoneal
approach. I tend to divide the diaphragm down to the central ligament
and mark that. Then effectively you are looking at your clamp zone. You
dissect around your clamp zone, both proximally and distally. We don't
tend to expose the celiac and SMA in particular, or the right renal.
It's important to find the left renal artery. For the visceral rotation,
you effectively extend the left colon up, find the white line and get
under that and get right onto psoas. The key is to get right down on the
psoas early on, and then it is a relatively bloodless field. Everything
has taken me to leave the ureters out of the way. I always take for left
kidney up. You will see in the textbooks and some advocate to keep the
left kidney down. I that's utter madness to be honest and I can't see
any point in it.

So for me, everything rotates up then out of the way. And it it looks a
bit strange, like a postmortem. It looks very odd to see the whole left
side abdominal cavity when all you've got is diaphragm muscle, psoas
muscle and nothing else left. It does give you a very safe exposure then
to the aorta. I don't tend to go round the aorta with slings, I think
that can cause problems. I go around with my fingers and be very aware
of the right sided lumbers or intercostals because you really don't want
to cause a problem there because you easily get into the right chest
from that exposure. So you have to be a bit careful so you can see
exactly where you're getting round.

\textbf{So in specifically with a type 2 TAAA, many people establish a left
heart bypass. Do you always operate in that way and do you use a cardiac
surgeon and the setting?}

I think type 2 you are mandated to have some sort of adjunct to keep the
rest of the body perfused while you're doing the proximal anastomosis. I
think in an elective setting left heart bypass is the right way forward,
because it does give you more flexibility and it allows you then to
sequentially clamp and keep the legs, the viscera or the kidneys
perfused. There are some negative aspects to left heart bypass, though,
in terms of needing a much higher ACT and bleeding is the enemy here.
The more you anti-coagulate, the more problems you've got. It's also not
pulsatile flow and you're putting all your cells through a pump and
you've got to be aware of increased problems around stroke and
everything else that goes with that. I think it is very convenient for
that set up, because you can get to the inferior pulmonary vein quite
easily and femoral cannulation is quite easy for you to return and then
you've got the option then of individually calculating celiac and SMA
for perfusion, whereas usually renals are cooled down.

If you've got a perfusionist there as well, you can get cold perfusate
for the renal arteries. So it gives you more flexibility, and if things
go wrong, you've then got an option to switch to conventional bypass if
needed or even drain out and go to circulatory arrest and cool-down.

So it does give you more options, however, in a more emergency setting,
an approach that tends to work quite well for us is to do an ax-fem
approach. You use an ax-fem graft onto the light subclavian artery, not
tunneled but on the outside of a body onto the right femoral and use the
other limb as a single cannula, usually for the SMA, because the SMA is
the king vessel with all of this. Most of the other things can go, but
if you lose the SMA, you've got a dead patient. And that allows you to
do an emergency procedure, a mid type 3 approach, without some of the
problems associated with left heart bypass. It allows you to have a
lower ACT; it gives you pulsatile flow; you're not smashing your cells
up all the time; and it's relatively quick and straightforward to do.
You don't have to mobilize a perfusionist and everything else that goes
with that. It's worked well for us in emergency settings. It's better
than a clamp and go approach because with a clamp and go approach, for
the type 3 repair, you need to complete in 15 minutes, your inlay
anastomosis at the top, the clock is already on. If you get down to the
visceral segment and you've got to do some removal of thrombus to get
your Corolla patch on or you've got to reimplant the left kidney
separately, it's a lot of time pressure and there's no opportunity for
something to go wrong there. That's where this gives you a bit more
breathing space that you've got the lower body perfused while you're
doing your proximal anastomosis.

\hypertarget{complications-2}{%
\paragraph{Complications}\label{complications-2}}

\textbf{As you've mentioned, open repair is a high tariff, high risk
operation, but apart from death, are there any specific complications to
the open approach?}

The big problems are bleeding and clamp times. Those are the things that
cause problems for those patients who survive. So problems with large
transfusion which cause problems with ventilation afterwards. The most
common complications after a TAAA are pulmonary with 8.5\% of one cohort
requiring a tracheostomy.\citep{coselli2016} Renal ischemia is an issue of
people will quote a 40 to 50 minute renal warm ischemic time, you are
then getting increasing problems with likely renal failure. They may
need to go on the hemofilter for temporary support, but these patients
have already lost a lot of nephrons, so they haven't got a huge amount
of capacity to lose more. That's why eGFR or high creatinine is a really
important prognostic marker of outcome in this patients. I think it's
like a barometer on their micro-circulation.

The big one and the Achilles heel of these approaches, whether it's
endovascular or open is spinal cord ischemia and that is because of the
segmental of blood supply to the cord comes from all the intercostals
and lumbers. If you've got that aneurysm extending both proximally and
distally involving the internal iliacs the left subclavian, then you're
taking out your crucial collateral supply. And that is why trying to
maintain blood supply, for example getting the lengths back in circuit
early, whether that's removing the large sheaths, during a long branched
approach or getting the leg supply earlier in an open approach, and
keeping the left subclavian in circuit. These are all other important
things, paying attention to the mean arterial pressure in theater, have
a spinal drain working, all of that is crucial in terms of trying to
protect the cord as much as possible.

Post TEVAR leg weakness needs to undergo urgent evaluation. Differential
diagnosis includes spinal ischemia due to subclavian or intercostal
artery coverage, distal embolization or stenosis of the TEVAR graft.
Stenosis should be treated with angioplasty and extension.\citep{buth2007}

\textbf{So the major issue is the spinal cord ischemia, and we mentioned
briefly the blood supply of the spinal cord for the sake of the exam.
Can you recap for us the blood supply of the spinal cord?}

Soit's complicated actually. There are anterior and posterior spinal
arteries, but I think depending on what level you are in the cord, they
get a blood supply from a more dominant approach. So higher up in the
cord---cervical and higher thoracic---vertebral arteries are important,
so hence the importance of a left subclavian bypass.

The lower you go, then they become a bit less important and the actual
segmental arteries, intercostals, become dominant. Much is talked about
the artery of Adamkiewicz. I think, yes, there may be a dominant vessel
at about that level, but it's rarely one, absolutely single one that if
you preserve that one, then the rest don't matter. I think they all
matter.

And then the more distally you go, collateral supply from internal
lilacs, median sacral, all those contribute to a collateral circulation
that should be seen in some ways all connected. And that is why, more
recently in endovascular approaches, staging repair is really useful
because you can allow the surviving arteries then to remodel and
increase flow. It's why, during a type 2 repair, when you get the whole
aorta open, it's very important to block the intercostals early---either
by sewing them off or putting a little Pruitt balloon in and to stop
losing blood from that collateral supply. It keeps the pressure in the
spinal cord. Also that's why, the differential position of that blood
supply is why patients then get a particular form of problem with motor
problems and sometimes preservation of sensation.

\textbf{So purely for exam purposes and a bit of physiology. Can you remind us
how to calculate the spinal cord perfusion?}

All that is really is map minus the CSF pressure. So it's your mean
arterial pressure, take out the CSF pressure and that's what you've got
perfusing the spinal cord. It is a useful equation to remember because
it allows you to decide what's the way to enhance spinal perfusion as
much as possible, and that is to increase MAP and decrease your CSF
pressure. We do that by enhancing the mean arterial pressure as much as
possible, and draining off CSF with a spinal drain to reduce your CSF
pressure and allow more blood into the cord.

I think people perhaps get a bit hung up on spinal drainage and it's
importance. It is just as important to maintain oxygenation and
hemoglobin over a hundred, reduce blood loss and all those other things
are as crucial. Spinal drainage is an adjunct, but it shouldn't be seen
in isolation. It's one of many adjuncts to try and help prevent spinal
ischemia.

\textbf{So in regards to the mechanism for spinal cord ischemia during open
thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, do you think it's related the blood
loss, clamp time or or implantation of the intercostals?}

I think it's multifactorial. So I think the majority is due to ischemia
scheme in terms of a watershed situation. Segments of a cord just not
getting enough blood. And the very reason the more typical area around
T7, 8, 9, to 10, is because it is in the middle between the vertebral
and internal iliac artery supply. This is probably a kin to a splenic
flexure of the colon, it's between two territories.

However, there is also potentially problems with microemboli or trashing
of a spinal arteries, which can occur in some patients. It's a slightly
confusing situation, but I think in terms of intraoperatively, blood
loss, dumps in blood pressure, with hypotensive episodes really don't
help. When do you remiplant? Again, that is a bit confusing. Some people
would argue if there's massive back bleeding, you don't need to be
reimplant because they're getting collateral supply from somewhere.

I think it will depend on how the case is going. We do use motor evoked
potentials (MEPs) but that's quite a specialist situation and you're
very reliant on the readings you get. They can be confused by leg
ischemia, cooling down or edema. But if you have already got the legs
back in circuits and got the MAP up and things weren't improving and
there was a sizable intercostals that could be reimplanted, well, then
that's worth doing. And that's why the technique of using Pruitt balloon
occlusion methods in pairs rather than ligating is good because you can
then just reimplant those. If you don't need to implant them, you can
just ligate and remove them. Whereas if you've already ligated them,
you've got a problem because you've already destroyed the ostia. We tend
to leave a branch already attached in the mid thoracic aorta to save an
anastomosis. You can, if you've got really good intercostals, fillet the
branch to open it up and sew it on like a long patch longitudinally
along the paired intercostals and then plumb it back on the other end so
it's a circuit in series with your main aortic graft. That probably
decreases the resistance to flow and that might remain patent for a bit
longer, rather than having a big 10mm graft going into a single pair of
intercostals with what are likely to have quite a high resistance, and
they probably don't last as long.

Severe spinal protocols have been described to reduce risk of spinal
ischemia or mitigate the impact of spinal ischemia in patients who
develop weakness.\citep{estrera2009, yanase2012} An easy way to remember the
important components are COPS:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  C - Cerebral spine drain status - keep for 7 days, pressure less
  than 5
\item
  O - Oxygen delivery - supplemental oxygen, increase hgb, increase
  cardiac index
\item
  PS - Patient Status - Keep BP greater than a MAP of 90mmHg
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So do you think we're good at predicting preoperatively who may get
spinal cord ischemia? You mentioned a few risk factors already that can
predict who will or won't post-operatively.}

I think we're utterly hopeless at it actually. I really don't think that
there's a good method. You can see people having an infrarenal repair
getting paralysis and you can completely replace the whole aorta from
the arch down to the iliacs with prosthetic and have people walking
around without a problem at all. So I don't really understand it and I
think that comes into the business about whether it is about emboli,
flow, or collaterals. I think it's a combination of things. When people
started embolizing intercostals preoperatively prior to endo repairs,
people thought this is a man thing---you want to keep them perfused
surely. But I think it does show the importance of maximizing the
collateral supply, and I think some people have a better collateral
supply than others. And of course, what we don't know is when you get
down to the more microscopic level of actual arterial supply at cord
level, what that is like in an inidividual patient. You can't see on
imaging. If that is already compromised, I suspect those patients are
more at risk than whether they have a macro vascular problem when things
go wrong terms of hypotension or blood loss.

Many reports state that the highest risk factor for spinal cord ischemia
includes length of aortic coverage or repair, followed by whether they
have had a prior repair, preop hemoglobin, and intraoperative
hypotension.\citep{bisdas2015}

\textbf{We haven't really touched on complex endovascular repairs yet, but can
you explain when you might choose a hybrid approach to this
thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair?}

So visceral hybrid operation came in really as a bridge between open
surgery and endovascular. This is a bit dated now, because it is before
custom devices and we only had thoracic stents at this time, the era of
the Talent stent, which was a very early thoracic device made by
Medtronic. Perhaps not the perfect name because it wasn't a particularly
talented, it was a difficult thing to deploy, but it actually got us
into the thoracic aorta. What we realized was that if you could operate
in one cavity, such as the abdomen, but still excluding any aneurysm in
the chest without cross camping and without rendering that patient
ischemic over a large part of their body---they could withstand that hit
much better than open cavity surgery with cross clamp and massive
reperfusion.

So the concept of a visceral hybrid was to do an extra-anatomical bypass
of the celiac, SMA and both renals from either the distal aorta or the
iliac vessels. So patients would only get sequential ischemia of one
organ at a time, say the right kidney or the celiac territory, and
during that 10 minute anastomosis, the remainder of the body and organs
were refused. And finally, at the end that, you could then put in a
thoracic device as a freebie, because you'd already perfused the organs
from distally. You'd ligated those target vessels and then you would
just excluding the aneurysm so that you were transferring blood from
above the repair to below the repair and retrogradely perfusing the
vital organs.

So it was very attractive and we started doing it quite early at St.
Mary's and initially we had some very good results in the first 30 or so
patients. And as always, then it allowed you to consider older, sicker
patients but it wasn't easy surgery. And actually I think because it was
doable in terms of just an abdominal approach and relatively familiar
territory for anyone who's done occlusive disease for the viscerals or
renals, I think a number of centers started doing small numbers and not
getting so good results. And then when better, custom made devices came
in, I think it's purpose became less and less because why would you do
that if you had an opportunity to do something which was even less
invasive.

So what we've been left with now to consider a hybrid type approach
effectively are those patients who are physiologically not fit enough
for an open approach and those patients who are anatomically not
suitable for a total endovascular approach. In some ways, they are the
worst of both worlds in that outcome group. And so I don't think you'll
ever be able to compare outcomes legitimately with the fitter group
having a fully open approach and the anatomically suitable patients
having a total endovascular.

But I must say we still see quite a lot in our multidisciplinary reviews
coming back. What surprises me is the durability of those grafts. The
visceral grafts remain patent for many years, some of them are 15 years
now. Occasionally there will be an accessory or small diseased renal
artery, and the renal grart will go down, but the others have been
extremely durable. And even though we've had to re-line the stenting
portion or extend it, the grafts have maintained really well.

A unique situation that uses a similar technique is with mycotic
aneurysms of the visceral segment of the aorta. The mainstay of
treatment is a debranching of the aorta and debridement of the infected
aorta with in situ revascularization or ax fem-fem bypass. There is an
evolving role for FEVAR, such as with most aneurysmal
disease.\citep{sörelius2016, sule2016}

S\textbf{o moving on to Type IV thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair. These can be
repaired using endovascular or open techniques. Can you talk us through
your approach to open Type IV repair in terms of exposure and any tips
such as how to minimize the visceral ischemia?}

So I think an open Type IV from a subcostal approach is a doable and
durable procedure. And what I mean by that is that the hit to the
patient is not enormous, and a reasonably fit patient can get through
that reasonably well. You have to be a little bit selective, but not
super selective. For example, in my first hundred, I had one 30 day
death and one in hospital death, which was someone at about three months
who just didn't get better, so that puts it into perspective that
actually it's an operation with a very good outcome, if you get it right
at the beginning.

The approach I mentioned earlier, nothing too special. This is a supine
patient. Getting the break on the table in the right position to allow
you to extend the abdomen. You lower both ends of a table to open up
that segment of the abdomen and get better exposure. I tend to do the
vast majority via a subcostal approach, some people would call it
rooftop, then extending on the left side down below the costal margin a
bit. And it gives you really good exposure even if you have to go down
to the iliacs. It does cause a bit more of a problem getting to the
right iliac bifurcation. The left is easy, because it's right there next
to you. So that's an added complication.

The visceral rotation needs to be done carefully because what you do not
want is to create blood loss right at beginning. And as I mentioned
earlier, it's getting under the left colon along the white line onto
psoas and then getting up under psoas and I always tell the registrars
when they're doing it, you've got to go as far as possible on psoas from
below. And when you think you've gone as far as possible, you've got to
go another five centimeters. So you get right up to the diaphragm from
below. And then you can get into the supra-colic compartment around the
splenic flexure and get your fingers either side of the lienorenal
ligament and take that off the lateral and the posterior abdominal wall.
The more and more you do, the more you are freeing and the whole of the
viscera comes up towards the right side of a patient and eventually they
will rotate up and you've exposed the whole left wall of the aorta.

The first thing I then do is ensure that I've got a clamp zone, and I do
that by dividing the crus which sometimes can be really tense at that
level. The crus can act as an extrinsic wrap around the dilated aorta,
to an extent that the distal end of the crus is almost ligamentous,
causing a tight band on the aorta. I tend to get my finger underneath
that before it with a diathermy and opening it, and then very carefully
choosing the clamp zone and getting my fingers right round that area, so
I know I've got a healthy clamp zone.

The next thing I then do is look for the left renal artery. I've already
tended to make a decision about what I'm going to do with the left renal
artery, which depends on the number of things. So it depends on, to some
extent, the age of a patient, where the left renal is in terms of a
clock face. So if you're looking at an axial cut to the CT, the more the
loft renal is around before three o'clock, up to two o'clock, the easier
it is to incorporate because you've got less aortic tissue there. Once
you're beyond 3:30, round to four o'clock, it's quite a long way away
and it's quite posterior on the sidewall of the aorta, or if the left
renal i smore distal compared to the right renal. What that means is
then it's a long way away from the right renal artery, which means
you're going be leaving a larger patch of aorta. This is usually bad
news, unless you have a more elderly patient.

You're making this decision about whether you're going to try and
incorporate the left renal artery into a big big patch or whether you're
going to reimplant it separately or perform a jump graft. So you've
already thought about that, but it's crucial to find the left renal
because when you've clamped and you've done your left aortotomy, you've
got to get that aortotomy underneath and posterior to the left renal
artery so that the orifice goes up with that segment of the aorta.

Then I tend to get the iliacs out. The left is easy, it's there. I have
no qualms on the right by going back over through the peritoneum to find
the right iliac artery to expose that. I don't go around any of them. I
just find a very discrete camp zone. You don't need much, just literally
enought to put a clamp on.

And then I tend to take the fat and lymphatic tissue off the left side
of aorta. So when you open the aorta, you've not got a lot of immediate
bleeding. If you've got a retro-aortic left renal vein, you've got a
line gate that cause otherwise you'd be going through it. And
surprisingly, on CT, the main left renal vein is anterior, but there is
often a vein there which has stretched across, either a lumbar or
phrenic vein, which you should deal with prior to your aortotomy.

It's about getting everything set up before you cross clamp, because
once you cross clamp, the clock is on. So it's getting the whole team
ready for that moment and making your anatomy as perfect as possible
before you do that. Obviously it goes without saying that you have cell
salvage and we use a Belmont with the big bucket on the top of it, so
that you can rapidly give blood back when you need it.

\textbf{Can you talk a little bit more about a Carrel patch and when would you
choose to do a jump graft to the left renal rather than encompass all
the vessel vessels onto that patch?}

I tend to think of a Carrel patch more in a way with a type 3 repair,
because with a type 3 repair, you've done your proximal anastomosis and
then what you're doing is you're putting on a patch of aorta to include
the celiac, SMA, and right renal, which tend to be together, whereas
sometimes the left renal is a bit away. The more tissue you leave there,
the more chance that aortic tissue will dilate to over time, hence the
patch aneurysm. If your patient has got some form of connective tissue
disease, we tend to reimplant directly.\citep{derango2011, afifi2017} There
is a very nice graft available with four side bunches already put on and
you can go straight onto the ostia. So you're basically leaving no
aortic tissue at all.

For type four, you are doing an oblique anastomosis and you have to be
aware that the right side of the aorta is really left there. It's a
compromise, these patients with atherosclerotic type aneurysms, they may
be in their sixties, seventies or even into their eighties. Even the
good candidates, they're not going to live 25-30 years, and therefore
over time that segment may begin to dilate a bit. I think that is
acceptable. Half of that segment is Dacron and the other bit may dilate.

I think if you've got a Carrel patch, which really balloons out, that's
something which is different. We don't have good dates as to when those
will give away and rupture. I think what is clear is that if you've got
dehiscence between your suture line and your graft, that is a dangerous
situation, akin to a false aneurysm. And although it may look similar on
CT, that's a different beast and they're at risk at any stage. True
aneurysmal dilation of a segment that is left behind is a bit different
and I think that's a bit safer. In essence, what you're trying to do is
a compromise between leaving as little aortic tissue as possible, but
also getting the patient alive through their first repair safely.

If I know I'm not going to incorporate a left renal, then I will sew on
a six or eight millimeter side branch onto the tube golf before I cross
clamp, because that saves you one anastomosis. And then now my favorite
technique is just to amputate the left renal artery and sew that
directly onto your branch and leave that in a bit of a lazy C
configuration in the paracolic gutter, so as the rotation comes back,
it's not under tension. The other technique is to have very short graft,
right from your aortic prosthetic, but you've got to really judge how
that will sit when the kidney is back in its anatomic position. So it
can't come off the anterior aspect of the tube graft. It needs to be
further down and that's awkward to judge and I think we're probably not
good at that so the lazy C is a better approach.

I much prefer that to trying to either reimplant the native artery
directly onto the Dacron, as they tend to restenose or try to bring the
aortic sidewall down on to the Dacron. I think that's fraught with
difficulty. You've often got calcification at the ostium, and it's also
very difficult because you've got the rest of your anastomosis really
close and sometimes not enough room to bring your clamp down, which is
exactly what you want to do. The left kidney will take a bit of an extra
ischemic hit, but you want to be perfuse the right renal and viscera.
You've got to have to bring your camp down below your proximal
anastomosis.

When it comes to late complications from TAAA repair, 8\% are from
progression of aortic disease and 3\% are related to the graft repair.
Risk factors associated with late events include female sex, partial
aneurysm resection, expansion of remaining native aorta or initial
aneurysm rupture.\citep{clouse2003}

\textbf{Have you ever had to treat the Carrel patch aneurysm in your career?}

We have a number from previous Type 3 repairs and I think these are very
suitable for fenestrated or branched devices. You've got a beautiful
lending zone, proximally and distally. Why not? These tend to be
well-suited to that and it's a much easier approach mixing endo and
open, changing from one to the other, I think that's fine. It's just at
a different stage of a patient's life and repair

\textbf{Any final summary or closing words about aortic surgery?}

We have a bit of a tipping point with open aortic surgery at the moment,
certainly in the UK. Looking at registry data, many are tipping back to
open now. Whether that was as a result of NICE guidelines, I suspect
not, perhaps that just put it more into focus. I think many people are
seeing more problems with patients surviving after what was very good
endovascular surgery at the time, but they've outlived the repair. Now
we've got problems with patients where you got to wonder whether that
wasn't perfect anatomy and should they have had open surgery?

Now the difficulty we've got at the moment is the patients that perhaps
weren't that suited for endovascular repair, did well initially from it
and they are paying the price later on. But those very patients are the
ones that are also more difficult from an open approach. They are
patients with shorter, more tortuous necks or more calcification. There
is a concern that there is an era of surgeons now that haven't done as
much open aortic surgery, who may not be as confident with adverse
anatomy.

That lack of confidence influences your decision-making, so patients
don't get a full appraisal of what options are available. The default
then may be to go with a less than perfect and endovascular option. I
agree, this may be less easy to kill a patient upfront with an endo
option but you perhaps pay for that later on. This is a very difficult
thing to get around and we've got to get to a compromise of finding the
patients with the likely better life expectancy and sending them to
groups with a larger open practice and get them through a big operation
safely and capitalize on those benefits.

The really lucky ones are the ones that are anatomically really suited
for endovascular repair and their sack really shrinks and their seal
zones remain good. They are the best of both worlds as they tend to also
be fitter with less extensive disease and get the benefits from a less
invasive approach. Not all patients are the same and we've got to now
accept that we've gone down the line of working with industry, which
they didn't necessarily focus on durability. What they wanted to do is
to extend the applicability, to treat more patients and get better,
lower profile devices to go for these percutaneous cardiology market in
the United States. And we're now paying the price of some of those
decisions, so we've got to reboot and take a stance on which patients
are going to actually benefit from which approach and have a better
evaluation of that going forward.

\section{Aortopathies}\label{aortopathies}}

\textbf{18 May 2020}: \emph{Dr.~Anna Ohlsson and Dr Sherene Shalhub; University of
Washington}

\textbf{What are the common genetic aortopathies?}

There are several well-known genetic disorders which account for genetic
aortopathies. The most well-known are Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz
Syndrome, and Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,

There are less commonly known ones such as Familial Thoracic Aortic
Aneurysms and Dissections due to pathogenic variants smooth muscle cells
genes such as \emph{ACTA2}. There are others in which the causative gene is
not known.

\textbf{Why are they such a big deal?}

These are cases in which the building blocks of the aortic wall are
defective. What I mean by this, is that these patients have pathogenic
variants in the genes that affect cell signaling or smooth muscle cell
structure that lead to suboptimal composition of the aortic wall. These
alterations ultimately lead to cystic medial necrosis in the aortic
wall.

As such they are at more risk for aortic aneurysms and dissections that
can lead to the premature death of the patient.

To put the frequency in perspective, Marfan syndrome occurs in 1:5000 of
the population while Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (also known as
VEDS) occur in 1:50000 of the population.

\textbf{Let's dive into them then -- what are the defining features of each
and the high yield information?}

The high yield information is being able to pair the genetic syndrome
and phenotype with its associated genetic mutation. A useful exercise
following this broadcast is to list the disorders in a table and write
out their associated gene mutation, what protein defect or deficit
occurs, the typical phenotype, and the common vascular pathology
associated.

But before we dive in, I want you to keep in mind some of shared
features. One is that the associated aneurysms and dissections tend to
occur at younger ages and dissect at lower blood pressures than what we
see with sporadic dissections (these are the dissections that are not
familial or associated with a syndrome)

One is that these are inherited in an autosomal dominant matter but
there can be variation in how the pathogenic variants are expressed
among affected people and even within families. The other thing to
remember, is that in roughly half of these cases, the affected patient
is the first in their family to have a given pathogenic mutation. The
flip side of this, is in half the cases, there is a family history of
aortic aneurysms, dissections, and sudden death.

\textbf{We will start with Marfan syndrome.}

\uline{Marfan syndrome} is caused by pathogenic variants in the
\emph{FBN1} gene (also known as fibrillin-1 gene). These variants lead to
improper formation of the microfibrils that maintain elastin, a key
component of the arterial wall.

These patients are prone to aneurysmal degeneration and dissections of
the aortic root but can also dissect the descending thoracic aorta. They
commonly have lens dislocations (ectopia lentis). They have common
skeletal features such as

being tall, thin, with long arms and legs, scoliosis, pectus deformities
(carnitatum or exicavtum), and club feet. They can also have a history
of spontaneous pneumothoraces and mitral valve prolapse.

\textbf{How is Marfan syndrome similar or different from the other genetically
triggered aortopathies that you mentioned?}

\uline{Loeys Dietz Syndrome} is similar to Marfan syndrome in all
the features including the aortic root aneurysms. They don't seem to
have lens dislocation and they have other unique features such as bifid
uvula or cleft palate, and hypertelorism (which is an abnormally
increased distance between the eyes). What is different about Loeys
Dietz Syndrome from Marfan syndrome is that they can have arterial
aneurysms of other arteries instead of the aorta, such as the SMA,
axillary, or other peripheral arteries.

\uline{Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome} has some shared features
to Marfan Syndrome with both such as spontaneous pneumothoraces, but
these patients tend to be short and can have easy bruising. They also
have similar features to Loeys Dietz syndrome in terms of arterial
aneurysms. Common features of VEDS would be thin translucent skin where
you can easily see their veins, thin lips, thin bridge of the nose,
large eyes, easy bruising, acrogeria -- or an aged appearance of the
hands

However, unlike Marfan and Loey Dietz, the majority of VEDS patients
tend to not have aortic root aneurysms. One thing to remember about VEDS
is that it is a \emph{subtype} of Ehlers Danlos syndromes. It's very
important to distinguish it from the other subtypes because most of the
other 12 Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are not associated with arterial
pathology. So people with vascular EDS are prone to arterial, uterine,
and intestinal rupture and their average lifespan is 48 due to these
highly morbid pathologies. 25\% of patients with vEDS will have
experienced some clinical manifestation by age 20, and that number is
close to 90\% by age 40.

\textbf{I remember learning about classic Ehler's Danlos presenting with
hypermobile skin and joints. Is this something you see with Vascular EDS
as well?}

Patient's with vEDS don't have the same hypermobile skin or joint laxity
as we classically think of with classic Ehler's Danlos. In fact, some
vEDS patients report losing confidence in their physicians who ask them
about joint and skin hypermobility because it suggests to them that
their doctor doesn't know about their disease process. These patients
often know more than most of the doctors they meet about their
condition, and it's a source of constant frustration for them. It can
also be a problem if the severity of the disease is underestimated, as
we discussed they can present much younger than most patients with
highly morbid issues -- like arterial rupture.

\textbf{You mentioned arterial pathology in Loeys Dietz and VEDS. Can you tell
me more about that?}

In both types you can see subclavian, carotid, SMA, and iliac artery
aneurysms and dissections, as well as less frequently vertebral, SFA,
and popliteal aneurysms and dissections.

\textbf{How do you diagnose these genetically triggered aortopathies?}

There are clinical diagnostic criteria for each, but ultimately genetic
and laboratory testing is very important for the final diagnosis.

Ghent's criteria is used to clinically diagnose Marfan's syndrome. The
big ones are aortic root dilation, known family history of Marfan's or
not, the diagnosis of ectopia lentis which clinically is manifested as
iridonesis (lens shimmering). Additionally, genetic testing for
pathogenic FBN1 variants is also diagnostic.

To date, there are 5 types of Loeys-Dietz as of last check. These are
due to pathogenic variants in the TGF-B signaling pathway, such as
TGF-beta receptors and SMAD3 genes.

Vascular EDS is caused by a mutation in the COL3A1 gene which encodes a
defective type of III procollagen. The defect in the procollagen makes
it unable to properly fold into a triple helix that forms the normal
collagen structure. This causes the defective procollagen to be degraded
intracellularly and as a result there is an overall deficit in type III
collagen which is an important component of arterial walls and other
structures. The confirmatory test for VEDS is collagen testing which can
confirm the collagen III defect.

\textbf{How would you manage these patients?}

Medical optimization and surveillance is key to try to extend the time
as much as possible before they get a dissection and avoid it if at all
possible.

We start with lifestyle modification. Avoid ``burst'' exertions such as
sprinting and weight-lifting. Anything that very strenuous. That's not
to say that they shouldn't exercise. Light exercise is encouraged, but
this would be activities like light jogging, swimming laps, or biking.

In order to minimize aortic shear stress, a resting heart rate of under
70 beats per minute and an exercising heart rate under 100 should be the
goal. This can be accomplished with beta blockers. Propranolol has been
shown to significantly decrease the rate of aortic growth in Marfans
patients with a baseline aortic root diameter under 4cm. There is
research into the use of Losartan in murine models that suggests it
inhibits TGF-beta in the aortic wall, which is an important pathway that
contributes to the breakdown of the wall. However, randomized controlled
studies have failed to show an increased benefit of Losartan over beta
blockers in Marfans patients. ACE inhibitors are also being tested and
are shown to decrease the risk of type b aortic dissection over 6 years.

In vascular EDS instead of propranolol, celiprolol has been studied by
the French and shown to reduce vascular rupture from 50 down to 20\% in
vEDS, although the mechanism of this is not yet clear and does not
appear to be necessarily the same as decreasing shear stress as in
Marfan's syndrome. In general taking care of these patients involves
trying to minimize complications from procedures and interventions. For
instance, use ultrasound for any line that is necessary and avoid
arterial lines, intramuscular injections, or other invasive lines if
possible to minimize the chance of a complication. Patients are advised
to wear medical bracelets notifying that they have vEDS.

We also discuss the importance of forming a care team based on their
needs. This usually includes a cardiologist, a cardiac surgeon, a
vascular surgeon, and a primary care physician.

\textbf{What about surgical treatment for those who need it?}

For patients with Marfan's, prophylactic surgery is recommended for
aortic root dilation \textgreater5cm or thoracic aorta \textgreater5.5cm. Often times the
thoracic and abdominal aorta are involved. Open and endovascular surgery
are options for these patients. Open procedures often include open
thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, open cardiac surgery for arch
replacement, or cervical debranching procedures. Endovascular procedures
can include regular TEVARs or branched TEVARs which require extensive
aortic coverage. Open surgery can be well tolerated and is ideal in the
sense that you can replace the entire aorta which avoids the future
complications from continued aneurysmal degeneration, loss of proximal
or distal seal zones, or device issues that can plague endovascular
methods. However open surgery, of course caries higher complication risk
and morbidity up front and does share some complications with
endovascular treatments as well. Sometimes these patients will have
hybrid procedures and often their care will require multiple surgery
teams including cardiac and vascular surgery. An important thing to be
up front with all of these patients about is that this is a long term
relationship with their surgeon, as they often require multiple staged
procedures, things aren't fixed in one procedure, and even after they
have been surgically addressed there is a lifetime of maintenance and
surveillance. Ultimately, the decision for open vs.~endovascular
approaches will vary between patients based on their specific anatomy
and arterial issues, what their body can tolerate, and ultimately what
their goals of care are.\citep{lumEndovascularProceduresPatients2012a} Some
may require having their entire aorta replaced, while others may only
need ongoing medical therapy and surveillance and it's important to set
expectations early.

\textbf{What about VEDS, when surgery cannot be avoided? How do you mitigate
the risk of complications?}

The tissue is very fragile. So using instruments that are the least
traumatic is key -- like fogarty clamps for vessels. Sutures often must
be pledgetted to reinforce them. Leave no tension on anastomoses or
suture lines. Always keep a backup plan in mind-- when arteries cannot
be repaired, can they safely be ligated or embolized? Generally any
large bore access for endovascular treatment is avoided because access
site complications are high and can lead to devastating consequences. In
situations of extremis, like a rupture, these patients' tissues have
been known to completely breakdown. Try to avoid the worst case
scenario, but of course sometimes it's the only option left to get out
of the OR. Be upfront with the patient about how complications may
arise, set expectations, and think about goals of care early.

\textbf{We discussed earlier that these aortopathies can have shared
phenotypic characteristics, some of which can be used in a clinical
diagnosis, but are all of these genetic aortopathies syndromic?}

Let's start by saying that all patients with Marfan syndrome and VEDS
can have the syndromic features we just talked about. However, it's not
always the case and the absence of these feature does not exclude the
diagnosis. In fact, we recently treated a middle-aged woman with an
aortic dissection who had Marfan Syndrome confirmed with genetic
testing. She had been diagnosed prior to her dissection because her
daughter had undergone genetic testing. However, on meeting her, I would
not have guessed she had Marfan Syndrome, had I not known. She was
average height, obese, and had no other relevant physical findings on
exam or history.

This ties into another genetic aortopathy that we have not discussed yet
which are the familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. They
do not have any syndromic features. For example, patients with ACTA2
pathogenic variants that cause alpha actin mutations which again
contribute to degeneration of the arterial wall. These patients tend to
present 10 years younger than sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysms,
generally in their late 50s compared to late 60s, and women seem to be
less often effected than men.

\textbf{Dr.~Shalhub, I know vascular genetics is one of your passions. Is
there anything else you want people to remember from this broadcast?}

Don't forget the family. Once you've made the diagnosis in one of them,
remember it is autosomal dominant, so it's important to make sure the
family understands and that they are set up with the appropriate care
team and monitoring. They may not all develop the same medical issues,
however as we discussed, ongoing medical management and lifestyle
changes are the key.

So I thought the first question was going to be a nice, easy
uncontroversial one and you've landed with CVI. What you've hit upon is
one of the main problems with venous disease, which is terminology. So
if you type in chronic venous insufficiency into Google, you end up
with, this enormous range of descriptions and how its used in lots of
different ways, by lots of different people.

One of the problems is that this led to a lot of confusion among people
within the space let alone everywhere else. So really important
documents to guide people to is the VEIN-TERM consensus document
published in 2009.\citep{eklof2009} The lead author was Dr.~Bo Eklof and this
was a document where a whole group of venous experts around the world
got together and said, okay, we need to be clear and define what all
these different terms mean.

And what are the terms that he found was chronic venous insufficiency.
And the official definition is it is a venous disease between C3 and C6
on the CAEP classification. We'll talk about that a bit later, I'm sure.
But between C3 and C6. In practice, it is used to describe the entire
spectrum of venous disease ranging from thread veins C1 all the way up
to venous ulceration. But technically it is C3 to C6. And I would urge
anybody who is learning about the terminology to look at the vein term
documents.

And silly little things like great saphenous vein and small saphenous
vein--I think UK is the only place where long saphenous is ever used and
the real problem was LSV in lots of other countries will be the lesser
saphenous vein, which is the small saphenous vein. So again, I'd urge
anyone to look at that document.

\textbf{How common is chronic venous insufficiency?}

Chronic venous disease is very common, with the weather getting a bit
nicer, people wearing shorts, you're spotting, venous disease all over
the place. The studies that have been done indicate that at least a
quarter, probably up to a third of people have C2 to C6 disease. So very
common problem, lots of people that need treatment.

\textbf{Now we would like to discuss the classification and scoring systems,
you mentioned CAEP, could you expand on that?}

So CEAP-\/-clinical, etiological (with an E because it's American),
anatomical, pathophysiological--classification system was introduced, I
think in the mid 1990s, by the American Venous Forum and American
colleagues. And it's a classification system.

So if you have a patient that comes into your clinic with a venous
problem, it's a system to allow you to describe that patient's current
situation in an objective, clear way. What it does not do is give you
any information about prognostication and it isn't useful for measuring
responses to treatment.

So it is purely a descriptive classification system. And the most
commonly used bit is the clinical bit, which is C1 one to C6. And again,
CAEP was just recently revised last year, a 25 year revision, which
again, I would urge trainees to have a look at, Dr.~Fedor Lurie was the
lead author, and just some useful revisions of CEAP.\citep{lurie2020}

Now in response to the limitations of CAEP, the Venous Clinical Severity
Score (VCSS) was created. So this is a 10 item scoring system, each item
scores between zero and three. So you get a maximum score of 30. Now
this is designed to be responsive to treatment and complimentary to
CAEP.\citep{vasquez2010}

There are lots of other things that have been described, quality of life
tools or VDS, but I would say that those two are the most relevant and
important ones to know about. But many of the QOL tools are too
cumbersome to use in day to day practice. We are in dire need of a easy
to use clinical tool that is validated for assessment of patient
reported outcomes. And again, the number of papers I've reviewed where
people have reported CAEP scores as one of the outcome measures in
response to treatments. That is not what it's designed for, for example,
you can never get lower than C5. You can never get better than a healed
ulcer. So again, that's the important distinction.

\hypertarget{evaluation-17}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-17}}

\textbf{When we do see patients in clinic with chronic venous insufficiency,
which type of imaging modalities should we use to investigate the
function and the anatomy of the lower limbs?}

If a patient comes to clinic, we can't underestimate the importance of
the clinical assessment. And when you assess these patients, you really
looking for two things, you are looking for the impact of their venous
disease on their quality of life and the impact of the venous disease
has on their normal function.

But also you're looking for complications of venous disease. This is a
clinical assessment. But then when ordering investigations, you really
want to identify underlying treatable causes of their venous disease.
And that's the goal of any investigation.

Venous duplex imaging is obviously the first line, gold standard that
pretty much anybody will go to around the world. And what that does is
essentially gives you information about the flow, both in the normal
antegrade, but also retrograde or refluxing flow in superficial and deep
veins.

It'll give you information about the anatomy of the veins , which will
help you to plan treatment, but it also gives you lots of other
information as well. It gives you information in the common femoral
vein, for example, if there's good phasicity of flow or if there's no
scarring. It helps you to evaluate whether there might be some outflow
obstruction, so duplex imaging is the absolute first line, gold
standard. For more on venous duplex scanning, see \ref{venous}.

Now, once you've done theduplex imaging, if there's clinical suspicion,
then of course we can move on to other investigations. So proximal CTV,
MRV, venography, IVUS, all sorts of other weird and wonderful things.
But clinical assessments and duplex assessment are the bedrock of every
assessment of every venous patient. So that's the foundation.

\hypertarget{management-29}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-29}}

\textbf{Moving on to the treatment of superficial disease. When we talk about
treatment of superficial venous incompetence, I don't think we can
really get away from talking about the two major studies, the
ESCHAR{[}@gohel2007{]}} and the EVRA\citep{gohel2018} \textbf{studies, which I know
you've been involved with. Can you review what these studies showed and
their importance in the care of our patients.}

Before I go into the trials, 'm just going to go back a step and just
talk about the general mindset that's important for these patients. So
what we're treating with these patients is not superficial venous
reflux. What we're treating is chronic venous hypertension. So we're
treating a global pathophysiological entity of which the superficial
reflux is one correctable factor. And the reason that's important is
that there may be other correctable factors, such as venous outflow
obstruction or other sort of mobility related things can be adjusted.

But they're also going to be lots of uncorrectable factors, such as poor
mobility, heart failure, dependency, ankle stiffness. If your ankle is
stiff, you can't use your calf muscle to pump effectively. You don't
have that mechanism for clearing the pressure out of your legs. So the
success of these treatments, particularly for the ulcer population, has
to be taken in the context of treating venous hypertension as well.

Having said that the aim of these trials was really very simple. Most
patients with venous ulceration have got superficial reflux. So what is
the role of treating the superficial reflux? That's the simple question
that was asked by these trials.

So the ESCHAR trial recruited between 1999 and 2002, 500 patients with
healed and open leg ulcers. They either randomized to compression or
compression and traditional, superficial venous surgery, stripping or
ligation. And that trial was very clear. It showed that with venous
stripping there wasn't a benefit for healing, but there was a
significant and sizable reduction in the risk of ulcer
recurrence.\citep{gohel2007}

So one of the criticisms of ESCHAR was lots of people didn't have the
same surgery. Lots of people had just ligation alone, et cetera. We
don't really do stripping anymore, it's all endovenous. So EVRA really
aimed to bring the ESCHAR trial up to modern practice. We randomized 450
patients with open leg ulcers to early endovenous treatments, delivered
within two weeks versus a more delayed approach. What EVRA showed, again
is common sense, if you do with the underlying problem, the venous
ulceration healed significantly quicker.\citep{gohel2018}

So put them together clear, unequivocal argument for treating the
superficial reflux in these patients as quickly as possible.

\hypertarget{endovenous}{%
\subsubsection{Endovenous}\label{endovenous}}

\textbf{Can you broadly outline the different treatment options that can be
offered to patients with superficial venous reflex?}

I have counted about 42 different ways of murdering a saphenous vein.
Long and short of it, there are lots of different treatment options. Do
something that you're trained in and proficient with and something
that's appropriate. Thermal ablation is in the NICE guidance and in lots
of other international guideline documents has been combined, whether
it's radiofrequency or laser. Although foam sclerotherapy therapy, when
studied in randomized trials, has lower technical success rates and
lower vein closure rates, the clinical success rates in terms of healing
are just as good. This sort of five, six, even 10\% reduction in closing
the vein, doesn't really seem to translate into a significant drop in
clinical effectiveness.

So I think the most important thing is not necessarily what you use,
it's doing it quickly and delivering it to the people that need it.

\textbf{When we are consenting patients for endovenous intervention, what
risks should we discuss with the patient and that they need to be aware
of?}

You can spend an hour doing this, if you're being very diligent. But
what I say to patients are that there are generic risks of venous
thromboembolism is the risk of any intervention. And I think that's
worthy of specific discussion after endovenous procedures, but I quote a
risk of around one in 200 for most endovenous interventions.

There's always a risk of bruising. And if you do phlebectomies, what I
often tell people is that bruising sometimes looks worse than it feels.
And with the thermal interventions in particular, I think the risk of
nerve related complications, so some numbness or some nerve pain, are
worthy of mentioned, and of course the risk of recurrence.

Foam sclerotherapy has a different mechanism of action. It's a detergent
that's injected into the vein that kills the endothelium. And there are
some people that have associated foam sclerotherapy with some
neurological events. So a very large registry that was organized by the
manufacturers of STS recently looked at 10,000 patients in the UK and
found very few events-around one in 4-5,000. Some people say that if
there is a history of migraine, then the risk of these neurological
events might be a little bit higher.

So, a little bit of caution, although in practice, I've treated many
people with migraines. But if you believe the literature, one in four or
five, people have got a little ASD and obviously we treated lots of
those people, so the risks are very low but it's just important to have
that discussion beforehand.

\textbf{Are there any techniques that we can use to mitigate some of these
risks?}

So I think VTE is something that is really worth specifically
discussing. I t's a very rare event after superficial venous
interventions, but it's potentially catastrophic. It's newspaper worthy,
if young people end up having a very bad outcome. What we've got to
realize is that the rate of VTE events is very low, there are almost
certainly some people that have got a higher risk. And so what we've got
to get slightly smarter about is identifying the people that have a
higher risk of VTE and maybe giving them prolonged course of
thromboprophylaxis, as well as appropriate counseling and mitigation as
well.

So it's about getting smarter about risk assessment. The current risk
assessment tools are not really fit for purpose when it comes to
superficial venous intervention. So the department of health or the
Caprini tools don't really take into account some of the really
important factors that I think do impact on VTE risk after superficial
venous interventions.

There's nothing validated, there's nothing widely available, but we have
a local, specific risk assessment for patients having superficial venous
interventions. There are major risk factors we look out for, such as
previous ipsilateral VTE, active malignancy, but also significant
chronic inflammatory conditions (i.e.~inflammatory bowel disease), these
patients have a much higher risk of VTE than we previously recognized.
There are also minor factors, superficial vein thrombosis, obesity,
comorbidities. All of these things are put together and we come out with
a score. For patients above a certain threshold, they get offered
extended rivaroxaban or low molecular weight heparin. So then we can get
smarter.

In addition, it is important to implement mitigation. So traditionally
things like a contraceptive pill, HRT and Tamoxifen, we wouldn't usually
stop them for a local anesthetic procedure, but being on an estrogen
containing pill doubles or triples your risk of VTE. It's an easily
reversible thing in the short term that can be done. So for my patients,
I would normally recommend that we stop the pill a full cycle before,
and similarly a month before and after the procedure.

\textbf{You mentioned it an extended course of anticoagulation for those
patients with risk factors. Is there a specific timescale locally that
you use for this?}

The venous forum produced some guidance the year before last in exactly
this area. We often only do about a week or 10 days for a lot of these
patients. However, if there's an ongoing, persistent risk factor, then
actually the VTE risk persists for four to six weeks, and thus there may
be an argument for up to six weeks of therapy in particularly high risk
patients.

However, if they are really that high risk, you've really got to
question whether a superficial venous intervention is needed, balancing
the risks and the benefits. But since for some patients the high risk
period persists for at least another six weeks afterwards, be careful
not to stop prophylaxis too soon.

\textbf{Moving on to a more specific question about treatment, what is the
role for treating and competent perforator veins in these patients?}

In most sensible practices, the more advanced the venous disease, the
more likely you are for the disease to be recurrent, the more likely
there is to be deep venous disease or posts thrombotic disease, and the
more likely you are to finding competent perforators. If you imagine
these patients with venous ulcer, it is very common to find perforators,
and if you take a sort of super aggressive role saying you've got to
obliterate every single bit of reflux you can find, then you'd be doing
a couple of perforators in every single patient, and that is the
approach of a number of centers around the world.

The pragmatic reality is, number one, if you ablate the superficial
reflux, we know that a lot of these perforators actually become
competent because we've got rid of the outflow or you've changed the
dynamics in some other way, and they've become competent. Number two,
even if they've stayed incompetent, the clinical benefit is still there
and is usually still pretty durable.

Now, of course, there may be some people that develop recurrent problems
and then there can be a more targeted approach to the perforator. The
ESCHAR and EVRA studies did not target perforators at all and the
outcomes in the EVRA study was the best healing rate of any published
prospective leg ulcer study. So, putting all that together, it's
difficult to make a case for aggressive treatment of perforators first
up. Having said that for some people with recurrent disease, it's not
uncommon to have a big mid thigh \textbf{Huntarian perforator or Cocher's}
perforator lower down on the medial side. So, I do treat perforators,
but almost always it's in recurrent disease with recurrence or
deteriorating symptoms.

\hypertarget{open-surgery-1}{%
\subsubsection{Open Surgery}\label{open-surgery-1}}

\textbf{So we've discussed quite a bit about endovenous intervention. Is there
a rule for open surgery in some patients?}

Open surgery remains the most commonly used superficial venous
intervention around the world, and there are still lots of centers in
the UK that primarily offer open surgery. Being balanced, it's a very
effective treatments if you do it well and if you use modern approaches
tumescent anesthesia ultrasound guidance, then actually some of the
traditional issues with open surgery, which are often technical and
complication related, don't really apply.

Having said that all the randomized trials have shown the same thing
while the effectiveness may be as good in open surgery done well, the
recovery is much better after endovenous ablation. So it's difficult to
make the case for open surgery when you've got something that is so well
established and the complications just so low, and it's cheaper when you
look at their theater capacity, et cetera.

So, I think there has to be a steady drift towards endovenous, but there
are lots of things stopping this. In Germany, for example, the
reimbursement is greatest for open surgery. So surprise, surprise, there
are still lots and lots of open varicose vein operations. And again, for
you guys, if you're going to change practice, the single biggest driver
for change in practice is reimbursement. If you can, you can change
where the money goes. You can change whatever you like. So, the final
thing is I've treated maybe three patients with open surgery in the last
five years. One was a GP, who I had treated the other leg with open
surgery a few years earlier, and she said, ``I want the same operation,
please.'' So I did struggle to argue with that. The other two were big
three, four, five centimeters saphenovarices in the groin. So specific
indications, but not really for most patients,

\hypertarget{medical-therapy}{%
\subsubsection{Medical Therapy}\label{medical-therapy}}

\textbf{So we've talked about endovenous and surgical treatment, but are there
any pharmacological therapies that can be used in patients with chronic
venous insufficiency?}

So we're pretty skeptical in the UK, when it comes to venoactive or
pharmacological treatments. If you go to Europe, they love them. They
sell like hot cakes. They're over the counter in a lot of pharmacies.
The drug with probably the most evidence is something called Daflon,
micronized purified flavonoid fraction.

So flavonoids are naturally occurring, venoactive compounds. There are a
whole variety of effects, only some of which we understand. But a lot of
studies have shown improvements in edema and heaviness. Daflon is
marketed by a French company and it's got good evidence, but they do not
see places like the UK as a big enough market because of our inherent
skepticism over these sort of things, to make it worth their while to go
through the marketing and the regulatory stuff. So it's not available.
But patients that have gone to France and picked it up over the counter
and have said it works well. So there may be a rolling and
pentoxyphyllin and these other things---there's some good evidence that
it accelerates healing of leg ulcers.

But I don't think we're very receptive in the UK in general, not in the
vascular surgery community to prescribe pharmacological or herbal type
remedies.

\textbf{What are the healthcare costs associated with the lower extremity
venous disease?}

The educated guesstimates in the UK, NHS, is around 2 billion pounds a
year. The UK NHS budget is about a 120 billion. So, up to about 2\% of
the budget, and that's just C6 disease. We're not even going into all of
the other diseases, the associated cellulitis, but also not only the
healthcare costs, but the societal costs, the time off work, the other
things. And then of course the superficial vein thrombosis, VTE and
other associated diseases, it's a massive underestimate

\hypertarget{other-complications-of-superficial-venous-disease}{%
\subsection{Other Complications of Superficial Venous Disease}\label{other-complications-of-superficial-venous-disease}}

\hypertarget{superficial-vein-thrombosis}{%
\subsubsection{Superficial Vein Thrombosis}\label{superficial-vein-thrombosis}}

\textbf{You mentioned superficial vein thrombosis, also known as superficial
thrombophlebitis. What is it and how do you manage it?}

I'm very pleased you used both terms because I'm going to take the
opportunity to encourage robustly the use of superficial vein thrombosis
rather than thrombophlebitis. The problem with thrombophlebitis is it is
too closely associated with an infectious etiology. And I can only
imagine how many useless courses of antibiotics have been prescribed for
the treatment of what has been presumed to be an infection. Of course,
there's no infection, it's a thrombus in a superficial vein. I think
what's really important is that traditionally it's been seen as just a
bit of a nuisance and let's not worry about it, treat with analgesia and
anti-inflammatories, and you'll be fine.

It's a really sinister pathology and an important cause of VTE. And
again, if you think about it, think of how many thousands, millions of
people that have varicose veins. They don't all get clots in their
varicose veins. They've all got stasis to a certain extent but they
don't get clots. So it's more than just the flow dynamics is going on
here. These people are thrombogenic. They have a thrombogenic innate
quality that leads to this. That's shown out in the study, some really
good work in some French studies. They identified patients who were
scanned with superficial vein thrombosis, and a quarter of them on their
first duplex scan had a DVT. A lot of these DVTs were remotes from the
superficial vein thrombosis. So they're not all extending into the deep
vein---they were remote---confirming this idea that actually a
thrombogenic problem is going on here.

So in the latest ESVS guidelines, there is quite a lot of stuff about
SVT treatment algorithms. I would urge people to have a look at that,
and it's important to risk stratify people. The closer you are to the
junction, the higher VTE risk, and actually for anyone other than just a
bit of clot in a varicosity, anticoagulation is the treatment of choice
to reduce progression to VTE.

So look at the guidelines, it's very clear what we should be doing with
these people, evidence-based, Once the anticoagulation is done, they
need to be re-scanned and that residual incompetent, scarred
thrombogenic, saphenous vein needs to be ablated, otherwise they'll
recur. So a real change in mindset and level of aggression.

\hypertarget{bleeding}{%
\subsubsection{Bleeding}\label{bleeding}}

\textbf{What's your approach to managing patients with bleeding varicose
veins?}

Really important question. It is a vascular emergency. There are several
depressing reports of patients having died from bleeding from a
varicosity. These are often elderly patients who are frail, who have
arthritis in their hips, and therefore can't bend down to press on the
bleeding varicosity down by the ankle ulcer. There's some very grim
photos in various case reports and it's really sad. There's two or three
photos that I've seen where an elderly patient has not wanted to wake
their partner and so has gone and laid down in the bath with this
bleeding vein that they couldn't control and basically exsanguinated.

So, it's a vascular emergency and these patients should be seen and
assessed and their superficial venous disease should be dealt with as
soon as possible. We had an emergency clinic running and anyone with
bleeding veins have the same urgency as the CLI patients and they were
treated there and then.

In terms of the treatment, there's two aspects: you want to decompress
the venous hypertension by ablating the saphenous reflux, but the
specific bleeding area, I think there's a real case for some local foam
sclerotherapy. You want to block off that vulnerable bleeding vein to
ensure that this doesn't happen again. But again, if anyone receives a
referral, these are people to see straight away.

\hypertarget{acute-thrombosis---deep-venous-thrombosis-dvt}{%
\section{Acute Thrombosis - Deep venous thrombosis (DVT)}\label{acute-thrombosis---deep-venous-thrombosis-dvt}}

\textbf{So let's move on to discuss deep venous thrombosis. You're recently
involved in the European society of vascular surgery, venous thrombosis
guidelines. In the most part, calf DVTs are managed by medical teams or
dedicated DVT services within the hospital. So in this section, we'll be
focusing mostly on proximal DVT.}

\hypertarget{physiology}{%
\subsection{Physiology}\label{physiology}}

\textbf{In medical school, we've learned a lot about Virchow's triad and the
etiology of venous thrombosis. Does that simple concept still hold true
today?}

I think it does. There's a few caveats and a few nuances, but I think
the principle that the flow, the vessel wall, and the blood constituents
are the main factors that affect whether or not you get thrombosis in a
vein is still pretty solid. However, there is also a real change in
mindset about the whole idea of provoked and unprovoked DVT. Again, I
would urge people to look at some of the new areas that we've covered in
these guidelines.

\hypertarget{etiology-10}{%
\subsection{Etiology}\label{etiology-10}}

\textbf{You mentioned there about potential risk factors for DVT, and that can
be classified into these provoked, which can be transient or persistent,
and then unprovoked risk factors. Can you talk about some of the
specific factors and causes?}

In general, what's been happening for several years is a recognition
that there are some DVTs that happened with a clear provoking
factor---the communist major, transient, provoking factor is something
like surgery, for example. So a lot of DVT are caused with that clear
provoking factor, but there's an enormous population of people that
don't have a clear provoking factor at all, or have a minor factor that
may or may not have contributed.

So traditionally there's been a dichotomy between provoked and
unprovoked. If it's provoked, they get a limited period of
anticoagulation is unprovoked it's long-term. And certainly the last big
thrombosis guidelines was the ACCP guidelines, the American CHEST
guidelines, and that's what they suggested, but it's much more nuanced
than that.

What we've got to remember is that there are some provoked DVTs where
there's much higher risk, and those are there's some unprovoked DVTs,
which actually there may be other factors that you need to take into
account. So I think for those people that are interested in this area,
it's really important to get to the nitty-gritty. So, long-winded way of
answering your question. But here are some risk factors:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Major provokes

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Surgery
  \item
    Major trauma
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Minor provoked

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Shorter periods of immobility - a few days sick in bed with the
    flu
  \item
    Contraceptive pill - deending on whether it was just started or
    the patient has been taking for two to three years
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In the guideline document is a big, long list of other things where for
people to think about it and consider.

\textbf{In those patients where, after you've taken a thorough history,
there's no obvious provoking factors. Is there a role for screening for
occult malignancies and thrombophilias?}

For thrombophilia testing, the history of it is really interesting. When
they were first identified and our ability to screen them first became
available, there's a lot of excitement because people thought they were
going to be able to identify a clear cause for all of these unprovoked
DVTs. The reality is that at least 50\% of them, there's no identifiable
thrombophilia. So what it almost certainly means is there's lots of
thrombophilias that we haven't yet identified, we can't test for. So it
hasn't really been the panacea in that regard. The other pragmatic
reality for the thrombophilias is that if we're going to be putting
people on long-term anticoagulation anyway, the additional value of
testing for these things is really very minimal.

And the ones that are really important---the thrombosis history is so
stark that they normally smack you in the face. So I think it's
generally gone out of fashion. And again, there's only very specific
circumstances where we would suggest testing them:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If you're going to be trying to stop anticoagulation, for some
  reason, the patients don't want to be on it, or if there's bleeding
  risks
\item
  There's a clear family history. Then it might be worth excluding
  some of the more sinister thrombophilias.
\end{enumerate}

Otherwise, certainly not a role for routine testing and similarly for
malignancy---for unprovoked DVT, the prevalence of an underlying
malignancy is somewhere between 6-10\%. The studies that have looked at
an aggressive, thorough assessment process rather than a more selective
process, have picked up a few more cancers, but the additional cost in
terms of anxiety, additional investigations, et cetera, and no
demonstrable improvement in outcome has meant that the guidelines have
not recommended routine cancer screening beyond the appropriate age and
sex specific screening---PSA, breast assessments, colonoscopy, etc.

\hypertarget{evaluation-18}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-18}}

\textbf{What is the algorithm for investigation?}

The most important components is the first component of the algorithm,
which is an assessment of the pre-test probability of DVT. So anyone who
comes with a DVT, you can go through a validated tool. The most common
is the Wells probability score, which is a series of questions and give
you an indication as to whether a DVT is likely or unlikely.

If a DVT is likely, then the algorithm is to do a scan, very
straightforward. If a DVT is unlikely, then the algorithm is to do a
D-dimer. Because if that is negative, DVT is excluded. The guidelines
are very clear on the assessment process, but a lot of this won't reach
our radars as vascular specialists at all until the DVT has been
diagnosed, so we don't appreciate the importance of the early stages. So
again, a quick plug for the guidelines, there's a very nice algorithm,
beautiful colors---I definitely recommend having a look.

\hypertarget{management-30}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-30}}

\hypertarget{medical}{%
\subsubsection{Medical}\label{medical}}

\textbf{So the exact choice and duration of anticoagulation in the management
of a DVT is probably beyond the scope of this podcast, but on the whole
are DOACs preferred over vitamin K antagonists, such as Warfarin and
why?}

In a word, yes, lots and lots of studies, funded by big companies that
make DOACs, have been done and they've all shown fairly consistent
things. They've shown that the DOACs are as effective as the vitamin K
antagonists at preventing DVT. They have almost always a significantly
lower bleeding risk, but they've got this enormous added convenience of
not needing regular blood tests, not having this dietary effect , and
the erratic control, et cetera. So the general direction of travel is
inexorably towards more and more use of DOACs.

A couple of other areas where DOACs have really shined: The tendency is
to recommend longer courses of anticoagulation and often indefinite
anticoagulation. A number of studies, both rivaroxaban and Apixaban have
looked at the effect of a lower dose of DOAC in these patients. So if
you need to extend anticoagulation, can you use a lower dose, a
prophylactic dose, so 10mg of rivaroxaban or 2.5mg BID of Apixaban. The
results have been impressive because the prevention of recurrent VTE is
very good, the same as the therapeutic dose, but the bleeding risk is
much lower. So you've got this additional benefit of being able to give
an even load those with even lower bleeding risk.

And the real icing on the cake for the DOAC has been a few recent
studies that have been looking at cancer patients. Traditionally cancer
patients where low-molecular weight heparin only, not for DOACs. But the
Hokusai study\citep{raskob2018} and the Caravaggio study\citep{agnelli2020} more
recently have both looked at Edoxaban and Apixaban in the context of
cancer and have shown that actually they're very effective.

In almost all of the areas, DOACs are demonstrating their superiority.
The one very notable exception is antiphospholipid syndrome,
particularly triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. This is a pretty
nasty acquired thrombophilia where Warfarin is still the gold
standard.\citep{pengo2018}

\textbf{Patients with a proximal DVT, in the iliofemoral or the
femoropopliteal segment, is there a role for elastic compression in the
acute phase?}

Traditionally people have been a bit nervous about putting compression
on patients with acute DVT, concerns about causing propagation and
causing PEs and all this sort of stuff. A very important study was the
ideal DVT study\citep{tencate-hoek2018}, run by a series of Dutch colleagues,
and a number of other additional studies more recently that have built
on the original IDEAL DVT study.\citep{schreurs2022}

The short answer to your question is that early compression is really
important. It's a really positive thing to do within 24 hours and it's
proper compression. It's not just the Ted stocking and see what happens.
It's 30 to 40 millimeters of mercury, so that in practice is a class two
stocking with a bandage on top. The benefits are reduces the early pain
and swelling of the DVT, but also interestingly, it reduces the risk of
post-thrombotic syndrome. So if you put compression on early, it reduces
the risk of them developing post-thrombotic syndrome. So a lot of focus
has been on clearing the vein and early thrombus removal and
thrombolysis and thrombectomy and all this sort of aggressive stuff. But
just by doing the compression, we can have at least part of the same
effect and we've just not been doing it. Very rarely do these patients
get proper compression.

So there is a big section in the ESVS guidelines about the role of
compression and algorithm as to when, how to use it, and how long do you
use it for. What we want to see now is the DVT pathways around the
country, around the world, updated and amended with this latest
guidance.\citep{kakkos2021}

\hypertarget{complications---post-thrombotic-syndrome}{%
\paragraph{Complications - Post Thrombotic Syndrome}\label{complications---post-thrombotic-syndrome}}

\textbf{One of the concerning complications of a DVT, particularly a proximal
DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Can you recap the symptoms of PTS
and how it's diagnosed?}

PTS is a fairly amorphous entity that includes a series of patient
symptoms and clinical signs that develop after deep vein thrombosis.
That's deliberately very vague, because the condition is so variable. In
terms of diagnosing PTS, the official diagnostic tool is a score of five
or more on the Villalta scale. The Villalta score is another one of
these tools that have been developed for both making a diagnosis, but
also assessing progression of PTS.\citep{kahn2014, villalta1994}

But in terms of sort of symptoms---people get swelling, heaviness, pain.
There is a very unique symptom, which is venous claudication, which is
almost pathonogmonic of post-thrombotic syndrome with venous outflow
obstruction. It's this pain which has a bursting tense quality in the
calf on exertion, which does settle on stopping, but it takes a lot
longer than arterial claudication. So sometimes people will take half an
hour to get better and the leg has to be elevated. So that's venous
claudication and that's often the most disabling symptom. But of course,
people can develop the same clinical complications than you can with any
venous disease---skin changes, lipodermatosclerosis, venous leg
ulceration, et cetera. Those are the summery of symptoms for PTS, seen
in up to 50\% but probably closer to 25\% of proximal DVT.

\hypertarget{complications---ivc-filters}{%
\paragraph{Complications - IVC Filters}\label{complications---ivc-filters}}

\textbf{A quick question about IVC filters. As vascular surgeons, we sometimes
get asked about the appropriateness of inserting an IVC filter. When
would you consider one and how long can one stay in situ for?}

So short answer is I virtually never consider one, and if already in
situ, remove as soon as possible. Let's expand on this a little bit. So
the history of IVC filters is a painful story, particularly in the US,
super aggressive use of IVC filters, very few of them retrieved, lots of
IVC occlusions, and major lawsuits against big companies. That's led to
a worldwide, reluctance to use IVC filter, so now we may not be using
them in some cases when we should be using them. The traditional
indications and reasons for using IVC filters included weird and
wonderful things like floating thrombus and other factors.

The reality is the only real indication that we could come up with was
when there's a proximal DVT, and there's a clear contraindication to
anticoagulation. So if there's no anticoagulation, then the risk of
propagation and PE is reasonably high, so there is a strong case for a
temporary IVC filter. If a patient is anticoagulated, very rarely can
the case be made for an IVC filter. I don't want to go into nuanced
details---such as where somebody already had a PE there's right heart
strain, there may be some anatomical features that you're worried about,
their anticoagulant control is borderline---there might be specific
cases, but this is really very rare. Most people anticoagulated do not
need an IVC filter.

\hypertarget{surgery-1}{%
\subsubsection{Surgery}\label{surgery-1}}

\textbf{So clot burden reduction techniques are a hot topic at the moment.
Before we talk about endovenous techniques, is there a role for surgical
venous thrombectomy? And when would you consider this?}

Open thrombectomy is part of the spectrum of early thrombus removal
techniques. It used to be very popular, a very satisfying technique---I
think I've done it three times. They've all been for the same sort of
indication, which is phlegmasia, severe limb threatening post DVT
change, and in a patient where they couldn't tolerate anticoagulation
and therefore weren't candidates for thrombolysis. So you're with a
patient where the leg is threatened, you can't anticoagulate them, you
can't thrombolize them. Then in that case this is a sort of last ditch
approach. But if that's not the case, then almost always a catheter
based approach is less invasive and more acceptable.

In addition, most people have got more training. Trainees should read
some of the descriptions of open thrombectomy--- it's a very satisfying
technique, but it's quite involved. It involves finding and exposing the
common femoral, deep femoral and femoral veins, applying tight
compression around the lower leg to milk the clots out distally to
proximally. So the original descriptions are really interesting, but
really very rarely would we need to do that.\citep{comerota2019}

\hypertarget{endovascular}{%
\subsubsection{Endovascular}\label{endovascular}}

\textbf{So you've mentioned catheter directed techniques for clot burden
reduction. Some recent trials have challenged our thinking on the
appropriateness of these techniques, such as the ATTRACT and the CaVent
trial. What's your take on the current evidence?}

This is very controversial. The fundamental issue here is that the
trials that have been done almost certainly would not have included a
large number of people who would benefit from interventions in the
opinion of the investigators. So if somebody has got severe DVT, it is
unlikely, particularly in the US, where the ATTRACT trial was done, but
these people would have been randomized into the trial.

So the immediate criticism of the trials is that this is not reflective
of the population. You've excluded the people that benefit, so it's an
underestimate of the benefit of the technique. But if we look at trial
results ourselves, there is a modest benefits. In the CaVent trial, PTS
rate was reduced. The quality of life was less impressive, but the PTS
rate was reduced moderately.\citep{haig2016} And in the ATTRACT trial, when
they subgroup analyzed the iliofemoral DVT group, then there was a
reduction in the number of people who develop moderate and severe PTS.
So I think the numbers are something along the lines of, you'd have to
treat 10 people with thrombus removal to prevent one person developing
moderate to severe PTS.\citep{vedantham2017}

So then the discussion is are those numbers needed to treat appropriate
for intervention? Particularly when you then start to consider the
additional need for stenting surveillance, et cetera. So I think the
jury is very much out and it's turning into a Brexit or a Donald Trump
like discussion. You've got really stark, strong, firmly held
unshiftable views on both sides of the argument and what we need is a
bit of nuance. What we need is everyone accepts that some people benefit
let's all work together, try and work out, which people benefit. Let's
work on case selection.

\textbf{So we'll put you on the spot then, when would you offer thrombolysis?
Which patients would you offer it in and which circumstances would you
also stent?}

There's no role for thrombolysis in anything other than the iliofemoral
segment. So if it's infrainguinal, proximal DVT, even if its severely
symptomatic, the studies that actually you cause harm by attempting
early thrombus removal. That's the first important point.

Even if they have got severe symptoms, there's always a role for
conservative management, compression elevation and a lot of these people
have a dramatic improvement in their symptoms. If they don't, and
there's an honest discussion, and the bleeding risk is low then
potentially there is a role. But when there's a treatment with a
borderline benefit or the benefit is unclear, then I think what we've
gotta do pick low risk patients, so low bleeding risk. We've got to
choose teams and techniques with the highest risk of technical success.
And we've got to pick people where we think the benefit is greatest,
i.e.~those that have the highest risk of PTS.

Whether or not you stent is very difficult. We had a case not so long
ago where we had a very nice result from early thrombus removal, we
stented, and the patients thrombosed again early and subsequently was
identified to have triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. Obviously
there wasn't the opportunity in the time to make that diagnosis prior to
the decisions around the thrombus removal, so you end up stung and now
this patient has a stent and can be very difficult to open up again. The
advocates and the aggressive stenters would say, you can't leave a
significant stenosis after thrombus removal, otherwise they will
rethrombose. Whereas others will say, if we go back to the early
studies, like CaVent, very few, if any, people actually had stents, but
actually their results were still reasonable.

I think once you get on the roller coaster of thrombus removal, it's
very difficult not to then proceed also to stenting, if you see a
significant lesion, for example, at the May-Thurner point. Final
comment, I'll make is that the use of recanalization and stenting for
chronic PTS is a very effective technique. So another approach, if
you're not sure, is to manage them conservatively, but always have that
up your sleeve, if they get significant PTS at six months, no earlier,
then we could potentially consider recanalizing and stenting at that
point.

\textbf{Following thrombolysis, what duration of anticoagulation is
required?}

So the whole point of anticoagulation after DVT is to reduce the risk of
propagation and pulmonary embolus, firstly, but also then to reduce the
risk of recurrent VTE. The aims don't really change if you thrombolyzed
or if you put a stent in. Some people used to say, I put a stent in,
we've treated the May-Thurner and that was the main cause of DVT, so we
can stop the anticoagulation. That's not the case. So it shouldn't
change and it shouldn't be any shorter if you've thrombolize and put a
stent in.

Now, whether it should be longer because you put a stent in that's
debatable. Some people have very aggressive anticoagulation protocols
after stenting, but that's to do with the stent rather than the DVT. So
remember the aims, which are to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE
and to stop propagation of the current event.

\hypertarget{phlegmasia}{%
\section{Phlegmasia}\label{phlegmasia}}

\textbf{Some patients may present with very profound, lower limb swelling.
Pain and cyanosis with a threat to viability of the limb. Can you
explain for us what phlegmasia is and an approach to treatment?}

There's two sorts phlegmasia that are described, but to be honest, I
don't think anybody has a detailed and robust understanding of what
these actually mean. Phelgmasia alba dolens is the \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=Phlegmasia+alba+dolens\&client=safari\&rls=en\&sxsrf=ALiCzsY3xqSSjZro2T2oiRHzVPLniGwqAQ:1665422481903\&source=lnms\&tbm=isch\&sa=X\&ved=2ahUKEwj727ybltb6AhXJoWoFHe3xCsMQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw\&biw=1121\&bih=1148\&dpr=1}{white

cerulea dolens is the \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=Phlegmasia+cerulea+dolens\&tbm=isch\&ved=2ahUKEwjIicmcltb6AhURQUIHHV_iC8gQ2-cCegQIABAA\&oq=Phlegmasia+cerulea+dolens\&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIICAAQgAQQsQMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQ6BAgjECc6BAgAEEM6BggAEAUQHjoECAAQHjoGCAAQBxAeUNTtA1jNhgRg_JEEaAFwAHgBgAF0iAHEC5IBBDE2LjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ\&sclient=img\&ei=lFREY8jvC5GCieoP38SvwAw\&bih=1148\&biw=1121\&client=safari}{blue
leg}
and the severe, form a phlegmasia. Theoretically, cerulea dolens has a
limb loss rate of 30-40\%-\/-severe limb threat, compartment syndrome,
skin blistering, swelling, etc. The reality is that it's often
over-diagnosed, so you'll see a lot of people saying I did venous
thrombolysis for phlegmasia and it's just a big swollen engorged leg.

The reason it happens is almost certainly a profound obstruction of
venous outflow. So the venous blood in the leg cannot escape. You get
this cycle of worsening pressure, leaking of fluid from the capillaries,
increasing pressure on the soft tissues. Then that starts to threaten
tissue perfusion and potentially if it's bad enough this will threaten
the actual arterial profusion of the leg as well.

So that's the sort of most severe and extreme form. I don't think
anybody has confidently linked the anatomical findings and features of a
DVT to what the leg looks like. There was a patient I saw who literally
had every deep vein acutely thrombosed from the IVC down to both lower
legs and was almost asymptomatic. So we've got this very uncomfortable
lack of understanding between the symptoms and the clinical and
anatomical pattern of DVT.

\hypertarget{deep-venous-obstruction}{%
\section{Deep Venous Obstruction}\label{deep-venous-obstruction}}

\hypertarget{etiology-11}{%
\subsection{Etiology}\label{etiology-11}}

\textbf{So finally, let's move on to talk about the treatment of proximal deep
venous insufficiency, both obstruction and incompetence. What are the
common causes for deep venous obstruction? Thinking about
post-thrombotic and non-thrombotic obstructions.}

So again, the terminology is important. So it's venous outflow
obstruction. Obstruction implies that there's a physiological barrier
causing the consequences. As opposed to occlusion, which is an
anatomical term. So venus outflow obstruction, is essentially anything
that reduces the ability of venous blood to escape the leg via deep
venous channels will cause an obstruction.

And again, going back to a bit of physiology. Poiseuille's Law talks
about the flow rate being the fourth power of the radius. So it's really
interesting. A question to ask is that if you've got a two centimeter
vein, how many, one centimeter veins would it take to carry the same
potential flow as a single two centimeter vein?

The long story short is that it takes 16 one centimeter veins to carry
the same amounts of potential flow as a single two centimeter vein. So
it doesn't take much of a narrowing to have a great potential impact on
flow. Of course, most of the time, you don't need that flow potential,
it's only an absolute extremes of circulatory stress that you'll need
that sort of potential, but it is interesting. And again, it also
challenges when people say there's great collaterals and that will be
enough. Well unless they're enormous, you need 16 of them to have the
same potential blood carrying capacity.

So in terms of the causes, the most common by far is post-thrombotic
disease. So when you've had a DVT, one of three things happens. If
you're lucky, the vein will recanalize completely. If you're unlucky, it
will obstruct completely. And if you're somewhere in between, you'll end
up with partial stenosis and obstruction. What's important is even if
the vein is open, what you almost always lose in the post-thrombotic
vein is a lack of compliance. It's not the same compliant vein that can
respond to demands and physiological need that you have, in a primary
non-scarred vein.

Other potential causes are a non-thrombotic iliac vein lesion, or
May-Thurner lesion. So the original paper, 1957, is very interesting
reading.\citep{may1957} There were a couple of Austrian pathologists who were
looking at kind of various specimens and they identified that a very
high proportion of people, particularly those had left-sided DVT had,
not only the overriding iliac artery causing compression, but they had a
secondary tight fibrosis in the iliac vein. So it's not just the
compression because any one of us in a certain position we'll have a
squashed vein. It's the fact that there's a secondary inflammatory
fibrotic change, which is what's causing the obstruction. So that's a
true May-Thurner or non-thrombotic lesion.

The other big group of patients of course, is malignant lymph node or
retroperitoneal fibrosis related venous outflow obstruction. But
post-thrombotic by far was the most commonly diagnosed pathology.

\hypertarget{evaluation-19}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-19}}

\textbf{We may see patients who come in with severe venous disease with skin
changes, for example. When would you consider imaging the proximal deep
veins in addition to infrainguinal superficial and deep veins of the leg
and what are the best modalities to do this?}

So we are really getting down to the importance of a detailed assessment
of the entire superficial and deep venous system. Every patient with
venous disease should have a whole leg infrainguinal duplex to start
with---that's deep and superficial veins. There's no real role for just
looking at superficial veins. So you need to understand the context. In
terms of if their obstructed or if they're refluxing. Again, remember
that, reflux on a duplex, yes, all we see is arrows going in certain
directions. But all reflux means is that after a calf augmentation
maneuver, there is some retrograde flow---in a superficial vein, more
than half a second and in a deep vein, more than one second. That's all
it means. So for example, you can have retrograde flow for 0.6 seconds
in a saphenous vein, and that will be labeled as reflux for all the rest
of the time that superficial vein is doing the right job, it's returning
the blood to the heart. So just be wary of interpreting what these
arrows mean. For more, see \ref{venous}.

In terms of how that affects your decision-making---one approach is to
consider the overall burden of venous disease, such as those with venous
hypertension. And what I try and do is draw a pie chart and say, you got
venous hypertension, here are the different causes of your venous
disease---that might include superficial reflux, deep venous reflux,
deep venous obstruction, and other factors. You try and apply some
clinical judgment as to what the different factors are.

Now, even if they've got significant, deep venous reflux and superficial
venous reflux, there is still a role for treating superficial reflux in
most of these cases. I still come across colleagues and other people who
say, look, you shouldn't treat the superficial veins if there's deep
reflux. But all the studies---EVRA, ESCHAR-\/-have shown significant
benefits, even if there's deep flux.\citep{gohel2007, gohel2018} So again,
the key message is treat the superficial reflux if it's there.

Now, deep venous obstruction and looking for it is a different matter.
There are again, lots of approaches, some people are very aggressive
about evaluating the iliac veins---CTVs and IVUS on everybody. The
problem is if you get super aggressive, then you start to over-diagnose
and if you start to over-diagnose, you start to over treat and this all
gets very messy.

I think the sort of people that have got clear signs and symptoms of
major venous outflow obstruction, particularly things like venous
claudication, history of previous DVT, really disproportionate venous
changes to the superficial and the infrainguinal imaging. Those are the
people that I would image.

And on the duplex imaging of the leg, if there are changes in the common
femoral vein that make you think there is a proximal problem,
particularly a loss of phasicity of flow then that's pretty concerning
for a significant venous outflow problem. In an unobstructed venous
system, the common femoral vein should really reflect the right hearts,
which has some phasicity. There should be transmission of that
respiratory phasicity. So if that isn't there, then you're thinking,
hang on, there's something interrupting that transmission, which is
almost always an obstruction somewhere. So those are the people I'd
image, but I wouldn't over image---because then you end up with a
headache and a problem---Should I treat or should I not treat?

\textbf{So you mentioned IVUS, what is intravascular ultrasound and what are
the particular benefits of using this technique over venography alone?}

IVUS an approximately nine French probe that is inserted into the vein
and it gives you a 360 degree view in B-mode ultrasound---traditionally
without color flow, just B mode---of the anatomical structures. What
it's very useful for is identifying venous anatomy, confluences,
identifying the size of veins, so it allows you to plan sizes of stents.
It really is an important adjunct to venography and other imaging
modalities. We did our first 30 or so cases of deep venous stenting
without IVUS and thought we were brilliant and IVUS was a waste of
money. And then we started using IVUS and realized I can't believe we
were doing this without. Once you start using it, you suddenly realize
that it's a really useful adjunct.

In terms of when you use it, in some parts of the world it's commonly
used for diagnostic because the risk of over-diagnosis, but more
commonly, almost routinely, for therapeutic, particularly when we're
stenting deep veins to plan our landing zones.

\textbf{You talked about over-diagnosis. Can you talk us through some of the
decision-making processes that you go through when you're assessing a
patient who has a deep venous obstruction?}

There are lots of patients that have this anatomical change, the number
of referrals I get from people who have done a CT and they've picked up
a problem. The most important thing is the clinical status and the
clinical picture. So have they got symptoms---go about right at the
beginning of the podcast---have they got symptoms? Have they got
complications? If they haven't got significant symptoms and they haven't
got significant complications then there's not really an indication for
treatments.

So leg swelling was initially, frequently pushed as, oh you're swelling
will get better, if we get rid of your obstruction. That's only the case
in probably less than 50\% of patients. The reason for that is that, yes
the original etiology for the swelling may well have been venous, but
you almost always get a secondary lymphatic dysfunction when you've had
swelling, for whatever reason---whether it's heart failure, whether it's
venous, the lymphatic system gets damaged. And so even if you get rid of
the original cause, the lymphatic damage persists, of course, and the
swelling persists.

The symptoms are very important and in terms of complications, if
somebody has intractable ulceration, et cetera, these are all important
indications. Butt a bit of skin change, a bit of mild swelling, careful
case selection is very important for these procedures.

\hypertarget{management-31}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-31}}

\hypertarget{endovascular-1}{%
\subsubsection{Endovascular}\label{endovascular-1}}

\textbf{So following a deep venous recanalization and stenting, what
surveillance do you offer for these patients?}

Surveillance has been evolving. The first availability CE (UK version of
FDA) marked deep venous stents in the UK was around 2012. A few services
across the country really got started at a few centers in 2012, 2013.
Initially there was an early scan and then a scan maybe at six weeks and
three or six months down the line.

I think we realized that in general, the people that developed problems,
often develop them very early. So we are scanning these people the day
after the intervention---obviously there's intraoperative quality
control and venograms and scanning---but the day after the intervention
to ensure that there's no early thrombus problems. Then we scan a couple
of weeks after to make sure that there's nothing that's happened early,
because there's an opportunity to re-intervene, to balloon, to correct
any technical issues, at that point. After that point, it's usually six
weeks, three months, six months, and then annually thereafter.

So that's a sort of protocol that we have and in general, what we've
seen is that people that develop problems tend to develop them
relatively early. So once you get to a year, then in general, the
patency rates are very good. In our center, the the chronic PTS stenting
primary patency rates at around three years are over 80\%-85\%. Of course,
there are some that have problems, but it's important to remember that,
even those that have thrombosed, they generally go back to the level of
symptoms they have prior to intervention. Which is very reassuring. The
last thing you want to do is to make people worse with a novel
intervention.

\textbf{And so what about your anticoagulation and antiplatelet regime for
these patients?}

There was a systematic review done a few years ago where all of the
published literature for deep venous stenting was reviewed and I think
the authors identified 28 different regimens for anticoagulation of the
stenting.\citep{notten2021} The honest answer is nobody knows, our approach
is to have low molecular weight heparin as the primary anticoagulant for
the initial two week period. And then at the two week point, they
undergo a stent. If there's no issues, they get transitioned to a DOAC.

In addition, the patients get six weeks of clopidogrel as an
anti-platelet. And again, the reason for that is that it's a foreign
material into the vein. Yes, the role of anti-platelets of renting
venous thrombosis is very limited but there has to be some platelet
related activity and platelet activation involved there. So it makes
logical sense to have some anti-platelet activity. Of course the
downside is that there's an increasing bleeding risk. These are the
constant tightropes that you're walking with these patients.

\hypertarget{surgery-2}{%
\subsubsection{Surgery}\label{surgery-2}}

\textbf{We've talked about endovascular and endovenous treatments, but is
there a role for open surgery in these patients?}

So in the iliac segment, very rarely. In some patients, you can do PTFE
reconstructions and bypasses. And of course the traditional operations
of Palma-Dale\citep{palma1960} bypass and May-Husni\citep{shaydakov2015} type
procedures. They all sounded very elegant in the books, but the reality
is a great saphenous vein going across the lower abdomen to the other
side is not really going to sort the problem out in a durable way for
all sorts of obvious reasons---the size of the vein, the pressure and
all that sort of stuff. So there's really very limited role for those
sorts of procedures.

Now, the one area where there may be a role for open reconstruction is
in the common femoral vein. The consistent observation is that good
inflow is absolutely imperative to get good outcomes in these patients.
And sometimes if the common femoral vein has got a lot of scarring, then
it's very difficult to reconstruct that inflow endovascularly. So a
number of authors have advocated the use of endophlebectomy, opening up
the common femoral vein, and cutting out the scarring and the
tribulations, putting a patch on it. Sometimes even putting an AV
fistula---a little six millimeter graph from the common femoral artery
onto the vein to really drive the flow through the stent. It's a pretty
complicated operation and you can imagine you're dissecting down and
there's lots of little veins everywhere and lots of lymphatics. The
wound complication rate is very high.

So really very limited role only---the endovascular approach is really
the way forward for these patients.

\hypertarget{pelvic-congestive-syndrome}{%
\section{Pelvic Congestive Syndrome}\label{pelvic-congestive-syndrome}}

\hypertarget{presentation-12}{%
\subsection{Presentation}\label{presentation-12}}

\textbf{So finally, let's talk about pelvic congestion syndrome. What is
pelvic congestion syndrome and how does it present?}

So it often doesn't present anywhere near a vascular surgeon. There are
a number of women who present with these chronic heaviness and dragging
symptoms in the lower abdomen. There may be some association with
menses, there's often dyspareunia and a whole variety of other symptoms.

There may be associated vulvar varices or posterior buttock and thigh
varices all as a result of pelvic venous incompetence. But it's a
complicated field---there are some people that have pelvic symptoms,
there are some people that have the varicose veins or some will have a
combination of the two. Almost always they will be seen and initially
assessed by the gynecology teams rather than coming to the vascular
surgeons.

\hypertarget{evaluation-and-management}{%
\subsection{Evaluation and Management}\label{evaluation-and-management}}

\textbf{When we do see these patients, are there any treatment options
available for them? And when would you consider treating?}

\textbf{I}n a highly selective way---this is venous disease in a
nutshell---the association between anatomical changes and clinical
symptoms is ropey at best. In terms of postpartum women, an enormous
proportion of these women have got venous reflux in the pelvis---if you
look hard enough. so the problem is that if you start looking for
May-Thurner syndrome, if you start looking hard enough, you start
identifying these symptoms and then you lose the ability to really
discern who's going to benefit most.

So again, I would go back to clinical symptoms as the single most
important thing. If they've got severe clinical symptoms majorly
affecting their quality of life and associated significant venous
changes, then those people to try to intervene on. It's not necessarily
a benign procedure. Pevlic vein embolization involves implantation of
coils. There's concerns about non-targeted embolization coils have ended
up in lungs. There are a number of people with unknown nickel allergies
that have problems with these coils. So again, it's not an area to be
over aggressive. So careful case selection is important. So again, a
quick plug for the ESVS guidelines. There is a very good section on
pelvic venous disease assessment.\citep{demaeseneer2022}

What's very important is again, to differentiate between pelvic
congestion syndrome and pelvic origin varicosities. One thing that is
certainly being advocated is that if the varicose veins are coming from
the pelvis, but there's no pelvic congestion syndrome, it's perfectly
reasonable just to deal with the visible varicosities from below---with
some foam sclerotherapy or other treatment from below, rather than being
super aggressive embolizing from above. But I think anybody who's
involved in managing this really needs to work closely with the
gynecologists. There are gynecological diagnoses that need excluding
before we start to address the venous disease. And there are a number of
validated questionnaires and other assessment tools that are probably
quite important. So not for the faint-hearted.

Iliac vein injury often able to be accessed by ligating the internal
iliac artery and mobilizing the common and external iliac artery.
Transection of iliacs should only be used as a last resort if this

\textbf{In Rich's Vascular Trauma Book, they described the injury extremity
index. Could you explain this concept?}

If I had to take one tool with me into resuscitation room or an austere
location to evaluate for vascular injury, it would be the continuous
wave Doppler. It's only more powerful if you can combine it with a
manual blood pressure cuff and together allow one to obtain an objective
measure of perfusion. One can slowly inflate the blood pressure cuff,
just proximal to the arterial signal, kind of like taking a blood
pressure, and measure the pressure at which the arterial signal goes
away. That can then be compared to a normal or non-injured extremity. If
there is no flow limiting arterial injury, the ratio should be one or
slightly greater than one.

Conversely, if the ratio for the injured extremity is less than 0.9,
then that's indicative of flow limiting injury in the artery to that
extremity. If the patient happens to be in shock or cold and clamped
down, the injured extremity index can be repeated 10 or 15 minutes later
as the patient is resuscitated and warmed.\citep{rasmussen2022}

\textbf{So what do you think the role of CTA is in the workup of extremity
with concern for vascular trauma?}

If there are hard signs of arterial injury, oftentimes the patient will
require an intervention without obtaining formal imaging. The question
about imaging often comes into play when there's a soft sign of vascular
injury, such as a reduced injury extremity index, audible bruit, or
injury pattern. We spent decades saying that the traditional
arteriography was the gold standard, but I think we can say now that CTA
has become the gold standard for the evaluation of extremity vascular
injury. CTA has improved in quality and it can also get imaging of the
head, torso, or other other extremities.

\textbf{And so whether the patient has a hard sign or a soft sign with a
vascular injury, can you talk us through some of the principles of
operating on peripheral vascular trauma?}

Foremost important is to resuscitate the patient and to be mindful of
his or her physiology and hemodynamics. As we said, an extremity
vascular injury can be somewhat distracting. Make sure the patient is
being resuscitated and warmed, ventilator settings are being corrected,
and monitoring is in place -- which takes a lot of communication with
the anesthesia team, the circulating nurse, the technicians, and the
blood bank.

I think once the patient is set and you have the team resuscitating him
or her, then you can turn your attention to the injured extremity. I
will prep that patient widely and be mindful that the incision is likely
to take more than what you think it will. For example, for an above the
knee popliteal artery, I will still prep that patient from their
umbilicus down to both legs; because you need to anticipate getting
proximal control, or doing an angiogram at the femoral artery level and
anticipate the potential harvesting of saphenous vein for conduit.

I also leave the tourniquet on and just prep it into the case. Taking
that tourniquet down prematurely can be problematic for a couple of
reasons. It may result in arterial bleeding, which in itself can be
catestrophic, but it can also result in hypotension which poses risk to
multiple organ systems. So, I just prep them into the field and then
communicate with anesthesia to tell them when I am going to let this
tourniquet down. Prior to doing so, I ensure they are ready, they have
blood going, and have a secondary measure to control bleeding as you let
that tourniquet down.

For the incisions, they just need to be probably twice as long as you
think they do. You can't fix what you can't see and if you can't see it,
you can't control it, and you certainly can't repair it.

\textbf{Do you routinely heparinize all these patients?}

I hate to equivocate, but it depends. It depends on whether or not they
have other injuries. So if it's an isolated extremity injury and the
patient does not have any torso bleeding, head trauma, or very extensive
soft tissue injury, then I will then be more inclined to use systemic
heparin during revascularization. If they have any of the above
injuries, then I will use regional heparin flushed up and down the
injured vessel.\citep{liang2016, fox2012}

\textbf{One question that I've heard come up a handful of times is can you use
saphenous vein from the injured extremity?}

Our teaching, as you referenced, has always been to use a saphenous vein
from the contralateral extremity, but I am quite practical about it. I
certainly have used ipsilateral saphenous vein. If there's no deep vein
injury and it's part of the incision and exposure, then I will use
ipsilateral reversed greater saphenous vein. If there is concern for
deep venous injury or if I have another person to harvest and who can
prep the other leg, then often I'll defer to that and use contralateral.
I'll be more deferential to using the contralateral saphenous vein in
the reverse configuration.\citep{liang2016, fox2012}

\textbf{So you have a vascular injury and you have debride it back to healthy
tissue. How do you make the decision between, primary repair, patch
repair, or interposition graft with autologous vein or prosthetic?}

You know, you can picture it now, you have vascular control with clamp
proximal and distal. Now you're setting up, you are really shifting
gears into a different phase of this operation. It's important to just
take a deep breath, I think at this point, and check with anesthesia and
make sure the patient's doing all right from a global standpoint.

I think the other thing is that at this point, I have sometimes
overlooked the importance of performing a proximal and distal
thrombectomy using the Fogarty catheter. I'll make sure that I've passed
a Fogarty catheter distally to completely clear the outflow of thrombus.
Then I'll use regional heparin, 40-60cc of heparin saline down the
outflow before I apply the clamp. I'll do the same in the inflow and
that buys you a little time as you're sort of thinking about and sizing
up what's in front of you.\citep{liang2016, fox2012}

I think in my experience, the majority of patients need an interposition
graft. Certainly, if it's a grazing wound or a stab wound from a knife,
there may be a role for primary repair or patch. But if one thinks
there's going to be any compromise of the arterial lumen or tension on
the repair, then you're better off with an interposition. \citep{liang2016, fox2012}

There are some special cases where primary repair might be appropriate.
Veins are much more compliant and you can often get away with a lateral
venorrhaphy. Then sometimes the upper extremities, such as the brachial
artery, has more redundancy. If it's a very focal injury and you can get
a little stretch, then you will often be able to get the brachial artery
back together primarily.

I suspect in the majority of my experience, vascular injuries require an
interposition graft. Then in regards to conduit, because most of the
wartime injuries were contaminated and quite dirty, we deferred to
autologous saphenous vein the vast majority of the time. However, if you
are in a pinch, can't find vein or don't have time to harvest vein, the
wound isn't too contaminated, and the injury is proximal, axillary or
subclavian, proximal femoral, or iliac, then I think using a prosthetic,
either Dacron or expanded PTFE Gore-Tex is also acceptable. Some recent
civilian literature says PTFE may be better than vein, but that has not
been our experience in the deployed setting.

\textbf{Now that we have covered some basic principles, lets dive in a little
deeper on each kind of peripheral vascular injury. First we're going to
talk about junctional hemorrhage, which is an injury in the junctional
area between the torso and extremity, such as the distal external
iliac/common femoral or subclavian/axillary region. These are some our
biggest fears and most difficult to deal with. Can you take us through a
hematoma in the groin or pelvis just above inguinal ligament--what are
the best ways to get control of this?}

For the iliac artery or even just the proximal common femoral, I think a
retroperitoneal exposure to the lower quadrant of the abdomen is
preferred. We sometimes refer to that as a transplant incision, which is
quite suitable depending upon the injury pattern.

As I alluded to before, don't underestimate the exposure you're going to
need. So, if it truly is a groin hematoma, think that this could be
common femoral or external iliac and in those cases, either a transplant
incision in a retroperitoneal fashion to get that controlled up to the
common iliac, or just doing a laparotomy and finding it through the
abdomen would suffice.

\textbf{What if you encountered an internal iliac injury deep in the pelvis
that you weren't able to control, what are the consequences of ligating
that?}

That's real tiger country, in those cases it's really damaged control.
One of the things we haven't mentioned is the important tenant -- that
maybe arguably is one of the most important tenants in vascular damage
control -- is ligation. We've talked a lot about setting up for a
vascular repair, but one of the reasons to check with anesthesia and to
assess the whole of the patient is to recognize that in some scenarios
the best thing is ligation and then dealing with whatever consequences
may result from that.

Keeping in mind, the idea of life over limb and not being too aggressive
about trying to do some sort of exposure and repair of a vessel that
takes hours and many, many units of blood. So in that context, I think,
if you find bleeding from the internal iliac or hypogastric vessels, I
think ligating those is quite acceptable. There can be instances of
pelvic ischemia, but if the contralateral iliac artery is open, then
that's quite rare.

Also, often one is dealing with artery and vein injury because they're
right there together. And as I mentioned, that's real tiger country. If
that's happening in those situations, keep in mind the tenants of
exposure, light, two suctions, and don't use too small of a needle.
That's where the SH blunt tip needle on a 3-0 or 4-0 prolene needle
works well. Don't try to be too finesse about this because, in the
pelvis, you won't be able to see your needle.

\textbf{Let's take the same injury and move it now to the external iliac--what
are the consequences of ligating the external iliac artery and what are
some of your options?}

Because it's the axial vessel to that extremity, I would not ligate the
external iliac artery with such impunity. I think in those situations,
controlling it and making that assessment of whether or not to repair it
is paramount. I think that the consequences of ligating an external
iliac artery are going to be significant and include proximal extremity
ischemia, including thigh, and probable need for above the knee
amputation and even disarticulation of the hip.

So I think the external iliac needs to be preserved at all costs. And
whether you reconstruct immediately or use a temporary vascular shunt as
a damage control is dependent upon how the patient's doing or if you are
in the field and there are other triage concerns.

\textbf{Some can find shunts a little tricky, can you give some advice to
listeners on how to best use temporary vascular shunts for damage
control?}

I think it's important to know what shunts you have available before you
are in this situation. So stroll through the operating room or your
stock room, wherever you are, when it's not busy and check out the stock
of shunts. There are four or five different types of shunts, anything
from what's referred to as the Javid shunt, Sundt shunt, or there's the
Argyle shunt. Then there can be makeshift shunts, such as small caliber
chest tubes, which are temporary plastic tubes that can be placed into
the injured vessel proximally, and then controlled with either a
ligature around the vessel to lock that shunt place or a rubber vessel
loop.

And then you want to make sure that you did not blow out any clot with
that shunt. So you let some heartbeats go with red blood running through
the shunt, then occlude it with the clamp, and then insert it to the
vessel that is distal to the injury.

Likewise, you have to make sure that the thrombus has been removed, and
I mentioned this earlier from that distal vessel. I think it is very
important before you place the shunt in that you try to clear as much of
the thrombus as you can, proximal and distal, and then place that shunt
in and secure it either with a heavy silk tie or plastic vessel loops.

Most of those shunts you can listen with the Doppler and you will see
arterial flow in it. So you can listen on the surface of the plastic
shunt with a little water or acoustic gel and hear the arterial flow in
those shunts.

\textbf{For our military docs out there, if they're deploying to a role and
their supply seargent calls them and asks what kind of shunts do you
want us to have --- what sizes and what types? What recommendations
would you give to make sure that you have them on hand?}

Yeah, it's a great question for now and it's a challenge for us in the
future. I think here and now, I would try to really make sure that the
surgeon put his or her hands on Argyle shunts. The Argyle shunts come
four in a container, there's a 12 French, 14 French, 10 French, and an 8
French all sort of in the same container. And its important to make sure
he has those. As the larger 14 French Argyle can work on an iliac. So
that would be one, and another would be to look for a 14 French chest
tube. And I would say, ``so these are my shunt options and I would need
to have these available.''

The other shunts, the Sundt and Javid shunts, are the other ones you
could ask for, but then you only have one size for those. And so those
and the thrombectomy catheters is what I would have. Because I think
it's very difficult to do an effective arterial repair without the
ability to do the thrombectomy, proximal and distal, because you will be
repairing that segment into thrombosed vessel with thrombosed inflow and
thrombosed outflow.

I think you have to get that vascular repair kit, if you will, assembled
and communicated with your scrub team ahead of time, so as to include
the specifics of each item: specific heparin saline dose, shunts to be
used, SH needle and some of the smaller ones, and thrombectomy
catheters. It is important to go through that series of tools that you
may find yourself needing. Also, keep in mind, we don't use pulmonary
artery catheters as much anymore, but they can be used as a thrombectomy
catheter in a pinch. And then those thrombectomy catheters can be used
as good proximal inflow control. You can insert a large thrombectomy
catheter proximal and inflate the balloon with a three-way stopcock and
that will afford you inflow control in a pinch as well.

\textbf{Say you're having a patient transferred in from the role to to the
higher level of care. Do you recommend these patients be heparinized, if
able, when they have shunts whether arterial or venous}

If they can be, then yes, that's tricky. As you can imagine. And it's
sort of similar to can one use heparin for the arterial repair itself.
Uh, and, and that depends upon whether or not there are other. Injuries
a head injury or torso injury, massive soft tissue bleeding or injury in
those cases. Uh, you know, I would not shut those, but I would not put
those patients on heparin, uh, because you, you, you will cause
bleeding.

So our experience is that, uh, the temporary vascular shunts in the
proximal vessels, above the knee or elbow, those shunts will stay Paden
without heparin, uh, for, um, you know, four to six hours because
they're high flow vessels and. Uh, I was once taught that the best
anticoagulant is flow.

If you have high flow in those larger proximal vessels, the shunts will
stay patent without heparin. The distal shunts, if they do clot off,
what we have found is that they don't cause harm when they clot off. You
basically are just back to square one with the occluded vessel and you
have to do the thrombectomy, assessment, and repairs.

So even if the shunts do thrombose, our experience has been -- at least
in the short term of the temporary shunts -- that in two, four, five,
six hours they do not cause harm when they thrombose. You just have to
do the thrombectomy and assessment at that time.

\textbf{To close out iliac artery injuries, if you did need to ligate either
the common or external iliac artery due to severe injury, what kind of
options do you have there?}

Well, that all really depends on the patient and their overall
condition. If you have found yourself not being able to put a shunt in
and in that scenario you had to ligate the external iliac, that patients
is presumably in a really bad situation.

You can ligate it temporarily. So thinking that I am going to ligate it
and then get some help. But in 2-3 hours, I am going t o have to go back
and try to re-establish inline flow with another set of hands, with more
blood, a different surgeon, different lighting, different tools, because
leaving it ligated will incur a tremendous amount of ischemia into that
extremity.

There are the options of a cross femoral graft. I don't think I have
ever done that in the setting of trauma, bringing a PTFE graft from the
other groin, the other femoral artery over to the injured femoral
artery. That would be extraordinary or unusual. But when the options are
just life over limb, and you have to just say: ``I can't repair it.'' The
scenario, whatever the reason, does not allow me to establish inline
flow and the patient's going to get an amputation and we are going to
work on saving his or her life, and move on.

\textbf{As we move our way down the leg, I want to stop and focus on the
common femoral and just discuss the principles of controlling the vessel
--- the options and if ligation is an option at this level for any of
the branches? Also, in residency, we would talk about blast injuries and
accessing the common femoral to get hemorrhage control. Is this a common
maneuver performed in the combat trauma?}

The common femoral is not much less consequential than the iliac. In
fact, it's probably every bit as consequential, as far as ligating it.
So it can be ligated as a damage control maneuver, but the consequences
will be significant if ligating the common femoral -- just as
significant as the external iliac.

There's three femoral arteries: the common, the deep femoral, and the
superficial femoral. I think similar to what I mentioned before, all
efforts should be maintained to try to maintain or establish flow
through those three, if at all possible, and balancing the situation at
hand, which sometimes means I have got to ligate it -- because of the
flow of casualties, because of the capability I have at a given leve.
Again, ligation if its life over limb is still an important damage
control maneuver. You just have to be ready for the consequences of that
and move on.

So controlling it, I think the Fogarty catheters are useful to control
the deep femoral. Sometimes from the open common, you can insert a small
Fogarty down into the orifice of the deep femoral and inflate that
balloon and control back bleeding from the profunda. Often there are two
profunda femoris arteries. They are difficult to control as they are
right adjacent to the deep femoral vein. So, oftentimes controlling
those deep femoral vessels from the inside using the small Fogarties and
a three-way stopcock is quite handy. Then, the same tenets apply with
either placing a shunt and trying to do a primary repair or some sort of
interposition repair.

\textbf{The popliteal artery is an area that we frequently see injuries and
they can be quite difficult to manage. Can you discuss just a little bit
about how you best expose and set up the patient when you are trying to
access the popliteal artery, both above and below the knee.}

Yeah, I will. And I skipped a question there. You asked about accessing
the common for control. I think that's acceptable, I mean, it just
depends on where the injury is and who is managing the case. I think if
it's an individual who has done, 15 or 20 or 30 of these sorts of cases,
and they feel comfortable about accessing the common femoral to control
it -- I don't think there's anything at all wrong with that. On the flip
side, if it's a distal SFA (superficial femoral artery) injury or a
popliteal artery injury, in those situations, most of the time it should
not require just a virgin cut down on an uninjured common femoral.

Now for popliteal, I think it is really important to get in-flow control
to the popliteal. One has to expose the above knee popliteal artery,
which is really the distal segment of the superficial femoral artery as
it comes through the adductor magnus or Hunter's canal.

You would start with a wide, long incision from above the knee to the
mid thigh. It is important to make sure to have a small sort of bump
with rolled towels that are placed underneath the calf, so that you prop
the leg up in a ``frog leg position'' and let gravity pull a lot of the
musculature of the leg down. Then, find the the distal superficial
femoral which is proximal to the above knee popliteal, just at or beyond
Hunter's canal.

And now move the bump above the knee. Then, make a separate medial
incision below the knee, again using sort of gravity in a way to pull
the gastrocs and soleus down, so that you can open up that below knee
popliteal space -- you are taking the muscles right down on the medial,
inferior edge of the tibia to open up that below the knee popliteal
space.

In this situation, you are going to need Weitlaner retractors.
Oftentimes, we have something called a popliteal retractor, which has
different depths of blades on the retractor. That's also referred to as
a Henly popliteal retractor or Pilling retractor (must be the company
that makes it). Those are awfully handy because you may need varying
depths in blades, deeper than the standard Weitlaner retractor.

And then being able to really put a narrow handheld retractor, like an
appendiceal or a Wylie renal vein retractor, that allows you to really
retract. If you are above the knee and you are not that well exposed,
you can put that narrow handheld on the inferior aspect of the wound and
sort of toe in and really get down into the popliteal space itself.

If you are below the knee, you put that narrow handheld in the proximal
extent and again, toe in and you really can try to get that popliteal
space itself exposed. If you need to, you can join the above and below
knee incisions -- sometimes with the trauma, the injuries are joined
anyway. Those are sort of some tenets.

Lastly, lighting. It can not be overstated how important lighting is,
sometimes that's a luxury for those of you who are in a deployed
setting. But these are the top line things to think about with popliteal
artery exposure.

**From one of my own clinical experiences, especially in young
patients, with repairing or bypassing the popliteal artery, many times
these patients have very severe vasospasm at the end of the case. So
that, even though you may do a beautiful bypass, you have minimal
Doppler signals in the foot at the conclusion of the case. Have you
experienced this and do you have any thoughts on this?

Yeah, for sure. If the bypass has sort of an above knee-to-below knee
and you have excluded or ligated the injured popliteal artery, then
absolutely, a lot of times the patient will be relatively cold and in a
vasoconstrictive condition. As long as you feel like there's flow in the
reverse vein bypass -- ie: you can hear audible flow and it's not a
water hammer signal, meaning that there's some diastolic flow in the
arterial signal, and then there's some sort of weak signal at the ankle
-- most of the time, I will just be done, warm the patient up, and
resuscitate them. If any of those things are not true, you don't have
any arterial signal in the graft, or if you do and it's only a water
hammer signal, or where there's no signal at all at the foot or beyond
the graft -- then, you have to open it up. Pass thrombectomy catheters,
proximal and distal, and get that regional heparinized saline, and
really make sure that there's not a real problem. But, that's really a
judgment call and it is anxiety-provoking for sure.

But you have to have faith. I do think that if you feel like technically
you saw all of your stitches, you felt it was good, you had some good
outflow back bleeding before you did the distal, you didn't forget to
the thrombectomy proximally, and you have signals -- even if they are in
spasm and you feel it's not as good as it should be -- in some of those
cases, you warm the patient up and resuscitate them and the signal will
improve.

You can also do an on-the-table arteriogram, but that puts you in an
austere location and can be a little bit of going down a rabbit hole.
You will see the spasm and then say: ``well, geez, now i need to
intervene on the spasm.'' An on-table arteriogram is certainly an option
and it should not be discounted, but I also would encourage folks that
as long as those things are true -- you saw your anastomosis, you
thrombectomized proximally and distally, you feel good about your
inflow/outflow, you have an arterial signal that has got some diastolic
flow (not water hammer in the graft), and you have some signal beyond it
-- warm up the patient and see how they do.

\textbf{As we continue down the leg, we encounter our tibial vessels. How do
you decide on repairing tibial vessels versus just ligating them?}

So there's a great paper I would refer you and your listeners to that
was published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery in 2010 with Gabriel
Burkhardt as the lead author.\citep{burkhardt2010} It was a review of the
U.S. military experience with the practice of selective tibial artery
repair. When you think about what that means, selective repair, it means
we repair some but not all tibial arteries. So how do you determine
which ones to repair? That was a good review article in the Journal of
Vascular Surgery that I think looked at maybe a hundred tibial artery
injuries. What we found from that experience was some principles of
selective repair which led us fix those patients in which all three
tibial arteries were injured. This means that it was not just the
posterior tibial artery, but because of the injury pattern, the peroneal
and anterior tibial had also been severed and there was just no flow in
the foot. So in those situations, we did repair them with a reverse
saphenous vein graft. That's the exception. Majority of times, as you
are alluding to and in that case series, we did not repair them because
we could ligate the single tibial artery injury since there was
redundant arterial flow to the foot. So you can ligate it, listen on the
table, and if the other tibial vessels are patent then it can remain
ligated and should remain ligated because tibial artery repairs are even
more technically challenging and time-consuming.

\textbf{We are going to shift our focus to cover venous injuries. What are
your thoughts? We have been talking a lot about the possibilities of
ligating arterial injuries. How do you approach venous injuries and
ligation?}

This would also fall under the descriptor of selective repair, which
means you repair some but not all. Without going into too much detail,
it depends. In almost all of the upper extremity veins, can and just
should be ligated. There is not enough muscle mass and flow in the upper
extremity veins to bother with repair. The exceptions might be a
proximal axillary vein or subclavian vein. But, by and large, the distal
axillary, brachial, basilic, cephalic veins can be ligated. In the lower
extremity, similarly, the small tibial veins can and should be ligated
-- there should be no attempt to repair those. Coming proximally in the
lower extremity, popliteal and then the femoral vein, if the patient is
physiologically stable and performing a repair is possible or placing a
venous shunt (we have had good luck venous shunts staying patent), then
we have deferred to fixing the veins in those cases. If the patient is
not in profound shock and if the expertise is there and present to do it
with operating time, I think there is benefit to fixing those veins.
There have been studies that confirm that this approach affords better
arterial flow in the arterial repair because the venous outflow is not
impeded.\citep{quan2008, clouse2007, rasmussen2022} Even if those veins
thrombose over time, they do it slowly and do not lead to pulmonary
emboli. So, when we can, we will fix those veins in the popliteal and
femoral segments. Conversely, if the capability does not exist, the
surgeon is not accustomed to repair, the patient is not doing well
physiologically, or there's the need for the operating table -- then you
just have to ligate those. I think ligating those veins in the popliteal
or femoral segment are also acceptable as a damage control maneuver.

\textbf{We could not finish a peripheral vascular trauma talk without
discussing fasciotomies. What are your advice for listeners regarding
fasciotomies?}

In the military setting, we have been liberal about the performance of
two incision-four compartment-lower extremity fasciotomy. I think they
should be done more liberally in our setting in the military. We
advocate for them and have shown that they can be done without
substantial additional morbidity and mortality. In fact, waiting to do a
fasciotomy or missing a fasciotomy has been shown to be associated with
mortality from early data from the wars. So part of that is in our
system, we often are going to lose track of these patients. We will see
them at a Role II, and then we would like to think, they don't need the
fasciotomy at the Role II because they will do it at the Role III. And
then we are not going to do it the Role III, because they can do it in
the Role IV. But again, we are going to be evacuating these patients at
altitude and they are going to go out of our care. So I err on the side
of prophylactic, two incision-four compartment fasciotomy in the setting
of lower extremity vascular injury certainly with wartime vascular
injuries.

\section{Abdominal Arterial}\label{abdominal-arterial}}

\textbf{22 Dec 2019:} \emph{Kevin Kniery, MD, MPH; Adham Elmously, MD; Todd
Rasmussen, MD}

\textbf{We are going to skip the preoperative workup and description of
anatomy and zones of abdominal vascular trauma, so please review this on
your own. As a side note, we are also going to skip the management of
iliac artery injuries as we covered that as part of our peripheral
vascular trauma session.}

\textbf{We are going to start with a scenario.}

\textbf{Scenario: ``You have a patient with a gunshot wound to the abdomen
general surgery has already prepped them from the neck to the knees and
performed a laparotomy from the xiphoid to the pubis They pack the
abdomen and temporarily have control what they said was pulsatile
bleeding from zone one can you take us through how to get supra celiac
control And in a case like this and in a trauma}

For a case like this, ust a couple of starter points. Should proceed
without you know close communication with the entirety of the
resuscitation team So I think if I was coming into a case like this or
participated in a case like this with you know with our team I would
start by making sure that I was on good terms with my anesthesia
colleagues that they knew what we were facing in this in this situation
that they were pursuing all the key tenants of damage control
resuscitation and and and all that That means meaning you know leading
with a blood product or whole blood resuscitation keeping the patient
warm and and all of those tenants So I would start with that and I think
as far as technically from a technical standpointin these types of
casesI will almost always you can't so what you can't see and I'll I'll
often really immediately assess my exposure I mean meaning the
laparotomy {[}00:03:00{]} So you mentioned thatLaparotomy in this case was
from the to the pubis And and and that's a great start Butbut for the
approach that you have referenced is likely to be needed in this case um
I'll often reset and actually come up a higher go between the and the
costal margin and almost begin you know two to three centimeters of Of a
of a sternotomy It's not a sternotomy but it is at least coming along
the SciFest side of the xiphoid and really release thoracic the inferior
costal margins of the thoracic under the diaphragm so that she can
really pull the diaphragm I mean sorry the cost of margins laterally and
up so that you want to suspend your costal margins so that you're almost
suspending the patient's rib cage up in a way from the aorta and the
abdominal contents So I think making a good assessment of your exposure
initially really important Hopefullyyou know {[}00:04:00{]} in in in the
case that I am prepping and in an operate on these cases I'll try as
best I can to use a retractor Such as thethat will allow for retractors
to really be placed up underneath the costal margin So again you can
spread spread those costs origins and try to lift the thoracic almost
lift the cost of margins away from the abdominal contents If if you
don't have an Omni you can still make sure that you're trying to OSE and
suspend thatum superior most aspect or cuddle Or cranium aspect of
yourof your exposure Once that's done And the other part of
communicating with anesthesia is to see if they have a nasal gastric
tube downsuper celiaccontrol of or in this case is almost always
facilitated by having a nasal gastric tube in the esophagus to allow one
to two You know to pop esophagus umin this area and and then be able to
get around that esophagus circumferentially and sometimes place some
sort of {[}00:05:00{]} umbilical tape or sometimes a Penrose drain to allow
for apt left sided Retraction of the esophagus away from the the a
cruise that's surrounding the aorta The other areas is really mobilizing
the left lateral segment of the liverso that that can either be brought
cephalad or tucked you know once it's mobilized can be Tucked in in area
early and brought to the right side or the whole portion of the liver so
that you've got the left lateral segment out of the way And now at this
point you know one is left with the cruise that's overlying the aorta
The other maneuver here sometimes dependent upon the situation is is put
into patient a little bit of reverse Trendelenburg to let the stomach
and and pull that stomach the inferiorally so that you create as big a
window as you can Oh with the esophagus retracted to the patient's left
the stomach kind of pulled down Sometimes you can have a resident or a
an assistant put their hand on the {[}00:06:00{]} stomach and retract it
towards the pelvis if you will Sometimes a little bit of reverse T-Bird
helps with that and you can kind of hopefully picture this So now you've
got the separated you've really The cost of margin suspended and now
you've got a window in which you can work And and at this point now it's
maneuvers dividing the skeletal muscle which is the cruise overline the
aorta This can often facilitated with a large right ankleyou know in a
Bovie extenderand you know in this case you know you can almost always
see that you're dividing skeletal muscle over the aorta if there's a
pulse hopefully there's even a weak pulse you know one can feel the
aorta and just divide the cruise over the aorta and and try to do some
blood dissection on either side to allow your patient of the spineOn
either side you know in these cases I typically don't try to spend time
getting circumferential control of the aorta It's not like an elective
aneurysm control So or elect bang chrism {[}00:07:00{]} repair where we'll
sometimes get round the entire order and these cases if you can get on
their side of the aorta down fineyou know that that is is is what is
needed and and is most efficient in these emergent sort of cases So up
there if you have other questions I mean it's a it's a unexposed which
requires you know a comprehensive set of of of things to think about But
I'll I'll

stop there for now

Do you have any

questions or comments

\textbf{Adham:} Somy question is sometimes you're faced with a situation of
entering a patient sad them and obviously there's a large rush of blood
and you think it may be coming from somewhere in the upper aorta Do you
think it's worth taking the time to get super Celia and control in the
in the way that you described before doing a video this rotation and
exposing the order that way Or are there any scenarios in which you
should do a medial visceral rotation first before you do that So take us
through can you take us through a {[}00:08:00{]} medial visceral rotation
When did she to want to leave the kidney down when to take it off sort
of the falls and advantages of doing each of those approaches

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah I think so That's a great question I think It is
worth getting super celiac control If in the scenario that you described
where where you you know the description is a zone one a hematoma that's
bleedingandyou know you you've got some a little bit of time you know
somebody may be holding pressure or but I do think it's worth getting
super celiac control if you think it's from the zone one Now if it's you
know the initial description was on one and then you get in there and
you look and it's actually it looks to be from the spleen or or from a
different area then then you can readjust But if it's truly a a a zone
one hematoma that's got active bleeding then I to answer your question I
do think it's worth taking the time to get super celiac controlthe
medial visceral rotation of courses {[}00:09:00{]} is designed to to to to
give upyou know optimal exposure to the left medial visceral rotation is
is designed to give optimal exposure of of the para visceral segment of
the aorta Sothat is you know the the the super celiac segment all the
way down to You know to the aortic bifurcation and and and and really
the left primarily the left iliac common iliac artery initially although
it can be taken across the ORIC bifurcation to see the right iliac as
well in this case that that is performed through dividing the white line
of told along the sigmoid sigmoid colon and the left colonand you know
establishing this plane and the retroperitoniumand and a good portion of
this is is steadyyou know blunt dissection it's facilitated with Bovie
electrocautery But it it is also um you know there's a plane in that in
this area that is developed with with with blood {[}00:10:00{]} to section
as well And in the setting of traumaalmost always this this detection
plane is taken from the sigmoid the left colon up to divide the the
attachments and grained the spleen and and the left kidney all the way
to the to the midline and then to the patient's right ultimatelyand I
think in in the setting of trauma the kidney is Almost always brought up
into this and and and just bring the kidney up I think it's generally
easier It's a little bit faster because you don't have to take the time
to to find that plane you know above the left kidney and to leave it
down in the setting of trauma Um I would almost always bring that left
kidney up

\textbf{Kevin:} Okay

\textbf{Rasmussen:} if that's yeah

\textbf{Kevin:} Yeah I think that's perfect one question I have is it seems
like the spleen is always getting in the way and always bleeding at the
end of one of these rotations Do you have any tips for managing bleeding
from the spleen

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Well I think thisgoes back to I think my initial comments
and and probably one of the key tenants of of this type of a procedure
is exposure and making sure that if you're going to undertake this that
you've really Gotcha Retractor you've got your incision up along the
alongside not just to the XY FOI but along side the XY Floyd and the
cost of margin so that you can really bring that the left cost of margin
both of them and suspend it up Because I think and in many cases what
you described is a result of just not being able to see welland soyou
know I think the the best I would the best tip I could give is is to
really try to make sure that that your exposure is as best you can and
if you're compromising on exposure um you knowwhich which is easier said
than done I I understand that But if you feel like you're compromising
on exposure or retraction that is that that's I think a contributor

to to

to splenic

injury

\textbf{Adham:} I have a question Speaking of exposure specifically about
eviscerating the battle I find myself as the as the senior residents
sometimes appreciating actually having difficult and nuances to do this
The way that I've learned to do it is kind of taking all the bowel and
finding a lap pad large {[}00:11:00{]} enough that's moist I'm placing some
sort of clamp or something around it and then having someone hold it
outside the abdomen but I've always found that it sort of ends up being
clunky or the bowel falls out of the time Do you have any tips on how to
eviscerate and control the small balance situation like this

\textbf{Rasmussen:} That's a great question And it is it's it is very
difficult to describe this using in a discussion It's one of those
things where you just got to feel it But in my experience this is the
and I hope those who are listening and you can kind of picture yourself
in the situation This is really the the the the main Purview and job of
the surgeon that's on the patients right So you can picture in a you're
on the patient's rights and and it takes a it takes ait takes a strong
and and I think big I don't necessarily mean physical but it takes a
strong and a big right hand to get that bowelthatyou know Often and over
{[}00:12:00{]} and to the patient's right side you're you know you're
pulling it from the left to the right And and I you know I'm sitting
here to describing it and my hand is I'm trying to extend my hand as
wide as I can you know and and it's it's not a subtle move It's notit it
shouldn't be a rugged but it needs to be very it can't be done with a
gentle it's Until a type of thing you've gotta be strong with it And I
don't use in this situation I'll get operative towels I'll ask them to
moisten blue towel or wet blue towel And you know basically what you do
is with you know with your left hand as you take that blue towel and you
put it underneath your right hand which has the viscera in it and you
know you sort of You tried to get it down at the base so that you really
that blue towel here and your right fingers are coming across the aorta
you knowcause you're taking it from the you know from the patient's left
to the patients to the midline and then {[}00:13:00{]} try to get it over to
the right and then put this big blue towel this wide blue towelyou know
underneath your fingers and then you know lay it out and and then
hopefully I mean this is where I I actually like in my situation or in
my preferences to use the Omni but you're going to need big a wide you
know retractor that's going to take the place of your right hand That's
going to now come in on the top of that blue towel And and hold all of
that and maybe a couple that hold that visceral you know to the patient
to the right of

the patient's Midland

\textbf{Adham:} That's one of those maneuvers that I feel like is very much
easier said than them and I've been

humbled by it

\textbf{Rasmussen:} it's very difficult to describe

\textbf{Adham:} I want to just ask a follow up question about the middle of
the medial visceral rotation that I asked her My question just to
clarify question is is there ever a situation in which you're faced with
a bleeding error where because of the time it takes to get super sealing
I control that you would rather do a visceral rotation and be controlled
being on it that way Or is your approach always Basically without fail
too if you have a high aortic injury to get your con control and then
immediately rotate the viscera and expose the order that way Secondly

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Well I think there'sgreat question I mean I think that if
youthere there are scenarios where if you if you If you feel like you
know you see the bleeding let's sayyou know it's zone one and all of a
sudden you you know you're getting ready to do this and you see that it
is a spurter from the SMA you know a superior mesenteric artery and it
doesn't look like it's the aorta for example And because there's some
structures of course in zone one that aren't I mean obviously they're
not some are not the aorta So I think that the scenario that you
wouldforego super celiac control would be a scenario in which you you
made an observation that you felt like you saw the bleeding It wasn't
necessarily from the aorta and you felt like you could kind of get it
controlled Locally you know without having to occlude a inflow from the
aorta So but thatif it's unknown you know and you have the you had just
you don't know where it's coming from in zone one I think short of that
I wouldadvocate for trying to get a super celiac control

\textbf{Kevin:} Greatso when we talked to the left medial this rotation for
our kind of med students out there we're we're thinking that there's
likely an aortic injury or a a a branch close off the aorta Um sometimes
you'll need to do a right medial visceral rotation thoughand that's
generally when you're kind of worried about eithergenerally a {[}00:14:00{]}
IVC injuryso Dr said can you just take us through a few of the nuances
of a right medial Chris rotation

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Right So this isyou know this from obviously from the
other side and this involves dividing the the White line of tollstarting
often at the and the coming along the right colon and bringing theyou
know the Sikh cephalad and and and the entire right colon you know to
the patient's left now and then cephalad it's I'm surprised most of the
time in these cases it's actually Not so much a rotation to the mid line
and then the left as it is bringing everything up cephalad to almost to
the patient's left costal margin for example They really are almost
bringing the CQM and the and the right colonYou know to the up onto the
patient's left chest in a way and and this is a plane that also similar
to the medial visceral rotation on the left {[}00:15:00{]} side This is a
plane that is largely developed with blunt dissection It's a combination
Once the the The parent Niamh retroperitoneum has been opened with with
some Bovie electrocautery than than the plane should develop And in this
case you'll see almost immediately the the left iliac vein and then the
vena cava And and you continue to bring the the left colon up until you
see the the left renal vein or I'm sorry the right renal vein and and
the kidney AndAnd and you know it did it's superior extent This willof
course expose the head of the pancreas the duodenum and the head of the
pancreas Andsimilarly um You know this the visitor in this situation I
get a a wet blue towel or operating towel I guess it can be white towel
but I don't really like to use a lap sponge cause it's too small and it
doesn't quite have enough substance And you will one willyou know place
that that {[}00:16:00{]} Blue operative towel down along your fingers that
are bringing this this all of the vis are up so that you really get it
all partitioned away with with a substantive operative toweland that
that has to be then you know cold in with a large retractors so that
your hands are free to actually operate

\textbf{Kevin:} Perfect one thing I just want to remind some of our residents
in medicines out there is I I would really go onto YouTube after this
and just look up left and right middle vis rotation that'll really help
solidify these points It's one thing hearing it but I think if you watch
some videos on it I think it'll really help bring it all togetherand if
you also want to

hear

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah I think I was going to say the same or to obviously
have an Atlas but are you know something because it's it is you got to
kind of combine I think the word that we're talking about here with with
some sort of visual aid the end the thing that I would recommend and
make a point is for those who have the opportunity to assist with spine
exposures So in these maneuvers that {[}00:17:00{]} we often perform as
assisting our orthopedic or neuro surgical colleagues to expose do
anterior exposure to the spine many of these maneuvers we're talking
about are performed in the spine exposure which which sometimes can be
overlooked by trainees And and and even They sometimes is well that's
not a very good operation You don't really get to so and and it's not
really a basket operation Boy I'll tell ya Um high exposures are a great
way to begin to nerve or learn the tenants of of of rotating the
visceral either to the right to the left and exposing the
retroperitonium

\textbf{Adham:} I think alsoprocurements have been extremely helpful for
liver and kidneythis right sided rotation Is it usually the first step
of any procurement And then you're kind of seeing the entire intro part
IOM So it's also a very good opportunity to learn some anatomy

\textbf{Kevin:} Absolutely And

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Great point

\textbf{Adham:}we haven't discussed the infer renal aorta yet {[}00:18:00{]} I
think probably a slightly more straightforward approach but can you
discuss your technique for inferiority exposure and then talk about I'm
kind of coming across the renal vein when you can like gate it how to
get it out of the way things like that

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Right So the the mostYou know the most common and maybe
most straightforward exposure is what we refer to as a you know
transperitoneal and from he's a colleagueexposure of thethe infer renal
aorta you know this here again people who are listening and looking
either at a videos or oror an Atlas kind of recommend or recognize that
the infer music colleaguemeans that the transverse colon isreflected
cephalad andit's one of the first moves is to really hold up the
transverse colon um in the patient's abdomen and and drape it up You
know cephalad almost on the patient's costal margin And often you
{[}00:19:00{]} know I'll set initially set a retractor Now that also goes
into a big to me is is partitioned with a operative towel a moistened or
wet operative towel to get the transverse colon um and retracted
cephalad and then the next move is to divide the ligament of Treitzand
this to me is always also a maneuver that's led by the surgeon on the
patient's right Um whether that's the primary surgeon and the the
attending or resident however you're configured this this maneuver
dividing the ligament of Treitz and and getting the you know fourth
portion of the denim which is to the left of the midline in a dividing
that ligament of Treitz that peritoneum and and and bringing that over
to the patient's right is is the next move Um and and that begins this
Process of you know getting really the the bowel Nowin this case the the
left colon is left remains to the patient's left {[}00:20:00{]} but you're
bringing all all bowel to the patient's rightthis this is not a medial
visceral rotation of of the entirety of the viscera This is only
bringing the duodenum the fourth portion of the Dudina and all of the
small bowel Partitioning it to the patients Right And and this also
again if one can visualize this be done by the patient the surgeon to
the patient's right and the right side of the patient bringing that
small bowel all the way across This also takes a wide and broad and
strong hand This can't be done with I don't know how else to say it It's
just a broad and strong sort of maneuver with with the hand to bring
this across and then and then partition get another wet blue towel I
keep saying blue I guess it could be white but operative towel and Yeah
Put that towel over your fingers And you know as you bring the small
bowel over that's the infer renal aortayou know this {[}00:21:00{]}
positioning Then retractors one will you know at the most cephalad
extent of that exposure begin to see the left renal veinat the at the
root of the of the colon mesenteryand you know at the at the caudal most
portion of this you'll see the aortic bifurcation Um andyou know that's
that's sort of the extent of this Thethe the the left renal vein Mmm Hmm
Can be like if if it if it facilitates aorta control Um obviously if one
is going to locate the left renal vein it's it's optimal to leave thethe
branches of the left renal vein So the gonadal eh the the lumbar vein
which also often will drain the left kidney and then the the the gonadal
So if those are left intact dividing that left renal vein can usually be
accomplished without causing a significant detriment to the left kidneyI
will say that dividing the left renal vein is easier said than
{[}00:22:00{]} done I mean it's it is you know it's a thin wall structure
which of course can bleed significantly itself So you know these are all
Sort of decisions that have to be made depending upon what what Andrew
you're dealing with and and the extent of your exposure

\textbf{Adham:}I think one question I forgot to ask you earlier was I think
Infor renally they are it is a little bit easier to get around
completely input you know an umbilical tamper a vessel loop around But
like you mentioned earlier Super celiac area That's a lot harder to do
when sometimes the goal is not to always do that but you have tips on
how to do that Because again I'd been humbled by that I'm in a
procurement one time when the attending allowed me to try and get around
it and I tried to bluntly with my fingers to get around the posterior
Huerta and had a lot of trouble So do you have any tips about that

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Well I think this isI mean this is just takes um you know
experience and and and And and and time I mean I in my own mind as I see
this I I you know {[}00:23:00{]} this is a combination of sort of a little
bit of Metzenbaum scissors a little bit of kind of pushing you know
cause what you're trying to do is to to to to free the aorta from from
the connective tissue around it to get back to the spine You know
sometimes actually almost always I'll use a metallic Pediatric yang
cower That is sort of one of my the suction or dissection tools of
choice is is pediatric Yankauer which is small and profile It's got a
blunt tip It will you know it is a suction device And so that's
usefuland you know kind of this combination of pushing a little bit of
maths here and there Metzenbaum scissorsand and a little bit of feeling
with your finger so you can get that connective tissue aorta freed and
then you know you can begin one can begin toto you know use a right
angle a big right angle and and try to to you know to get underneath it
Obviously what you're looking for here in {[}00:24:00{]} part is is a Is
lumbar you know you're looking for the lumbar vessels which you know
those are the things you need to leave behind for at least by as we tell
our residents you know find the outside before you find the inside you
can find them outside before you find the inside of a lumbar Then you
can clip ityou know another I think very useful tool in this situation
is is having large Weck cliffs you know because you're not it's very
difficult to pass you know a silk to lie gate a lumbar And in these
situations a lot of times you know you need those large WEC medium to
large Weck clips to help you know get on either side of a of a lumbar
artery or vein

\textbf{Kevin:} Great one quick point back to their renal vein I kind of
picked this up just as fast past week is you can really get a lot of
mobilization on the renal vein just by ligating some of the smaller
branchesout distantly on it not even the gonadal but sometimes the
adrenal vein and a few of those veins And you can really get you know
five centimeters a {[}00:25:00{]} mobilization of that renal vein which
should give you enough distance to clamp Um But now we're going to go
intoeach vessel off the aorta I know this isn't exactly what you're
going to see in a trauma You don't have isolated celiac artery injury or
isolated SMA injury but just for the sake of learning we're going to
talk through each vessel and talk about the options of exposing it and
then repairing it So starting approximately a Dr.~Rasmussencan you
discuss what the best ways to see the celiac artery are andany options
for repairing it

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah So the you know the celiac arteryI guess the origin
of the celiac arterycan be seen either through the lesser SAC this is
again through you know an an sort of a I guess an anterior approach\\
through the stackand this is would likely be very similar to the
exposure we talked about with a super celiac aortic exposure where the
cause retracted you know caudally down towards the pelvis{[}00:26:00{]} and
um You know that opening lesser sack and pulling the stomach down and
and sort of getting the pancreas to come down That will expose then the
the origin of the first centimeter to the celiac artery If the proximal
segment of the celiac artery is injured and bleeding then then the
repair optionsyou know I I think lend into the category of any vascular
know major vascular three If it can be prepared repaired primarily then
you know using\\
four Oh five Oh proline future If it does a grazing wound and repairing
it primarily can be done then then that's that's one option if it's a
largeyou know\\
celiac artery injury that that cannot be repaired primarily and there's
destruction of the wall Oftentimes you're an individuals in a dam Really
a damage control situation there And repair is not so much Your first a
lot of thought You're {[}00:27:00{]} really situation trying to just control
bleeding and save patient's life And and so in those cases you know
controlling the celiac artery and even consider you know ligating it may
be necessaryyou know as a damage control maneuver at least initiallythe
other way to see the origin of the celiac artery is still left medial
visceral rotation So the maneuver we described before will show the
entire we'll expose the the para visceral segment of the aorta

um to include the first centimeter to the celiac artery

\textbf{Adham:} so any keys to identifying the common hepatic artery and
againthoughts on ligation strategies and repairs

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Right So I think the you know I think I mean the common a
paddock you'll need to that will not be able to be visualized through
the left medial visceral rotation that the common hepatic and getting
out into the {[}00:28:00{]} segments there of of the of the the major
branches of the celiac one we'll need then in that case to be coming
from a you know a transparent to Neal you know anterior approach with a
lesser SAC And you know di identifying the common a paddockyou know is
isMmm You know requires sort of a recognition of where the celiac artery
is You're in the lesser SAC The stomach really has to be Ah inferiorly
This is again if you find yourself operating in this space you know the
the the costal margins as I said to begin really have to be flared And
almost suspended upso that you've really opened this Sometimes reverse
Trendelenburg is useful getting a hand a resident or a med student's
hand to pull the stomach downand open up that that that spaceum it you
know that that will then should expose then the you know the the the
second and third segments of the celiac and its major branches to
include the common {[}00:29:00{]} hepatic artery

\textbf{Kevin:} Great And so as far as like getting the common hepatic artery
how does the GDA play into this And by that I mean the gastroduodenal
artery

\textbf{Rasmussen:} I mean you know the the the the GDA is as I guess is most
commonly the case is you know and and listeners know is Really one of
the first or the first branch of the common hepatic artery and and
really defines the junction between the common hepatic and proper
paddock arteriesand I thinkI mean ideally um The common hepatic should
should not ideally you don't want to legging any of these arteries right
So I think that we start with that premise to say geez if we can get a
repair done that's going to be our that's going to beoption awhether
that's the common hepatic proper paddock or GDA just like any artery in
the body like 18 it may be required as it is a damage control maneuver
just to control hemorrhage {[}00:30:00{]} let the patient recover a little
bit talk to anesthesia and sort of see how things are going Make an
assessment of of of the region distal to where you've liked it So so
this is just a basic tenant of like aiding any artery in a damage
control situation we recognize no matter which artery rely gating the
consequences of that ligation or we need to assess those consequences
and then and then address them if we're able if patients you know able
to um to move to the next step Soobviously liking the comment of paddock
distal to the GDA likely to Render you know a significant portion of the
of the duodenum the pancreas and and then the liver is schemicand so you
know if the light station can occur proximal if the injury is proximal
to the GDA um then you know that would and G and perfusion can be
maintained into the GDA then that's that's preferable{[}00:31:00{]}but if I
was in one of these situations or when I am And we find ourselves having
to like ate it or we like hated it We didn't quite know cause we didn't
but we had to you know I was bleeding and there was a clip when we had a
damage control overand now Jeannie or the common paddock or the proper
paddocks lie dated Now what I usually will talk to anesthesia We'll get
the patient as resuscitate as we can We'll get out the Doppler we'll
make an assessment because you know dependent upon patients can tolerate
but depending on the resuscitation status collateral where your legation
isyou know they may be able to tolerate having any one of those vessels
legged If on the other hand without your Doppler and you get the patient
resuscitate as possible and there's clear aschemia then you're going to
be faced with the decision whether or not we need a reconstruct the this
leg vessel shuntedor you know it may be situation where you have to deal
with the metabolic consequences and leave the {[}00:32:00{]} leave at like
eight There's not one answer You know that I think there's a there's not
one answer that applies to all situations It's a I think it's a learning
and adhering to the principles of damage control resuscitation and
damage control surgery

\textbf{Kevin:} Absolutelyso off the record dr real quick I think you miss
said the distal and proximal cause you can lie gate the you can like it
The common a paddock Proximal to the GDA because you'll have retrograde
flow from the GDA into the proper hepatic Rightcould you just say that
sentence and one more time and then

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Sure what I guess what I'm what I'm meant to say And I
don't you know actually looking at a diagram so I can try to see the so
what I meant to say is that you can often lie gait the common hepatic
proximal GDA keeping a retrograde filling into the GDA and maintaining a
viability of the Dudina and the pancreatic head

\textbf{Kevin:} Perfect Thank you Okay And now let's dive into the Um and
this is you know very close in proximity to the celiac artery So many of
the options to visualize it will be the same but there's some unique
differences A is with its relationship with the pancreas Um so briefly
doctor asked me Jason what are our options to see the SMA and and and do
we kind of think of SMA kind of in portions a little differently than
some

other vessels

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Definitely So the the SMAyou know the the the pathway
really to see the first centimeter to the SMA superior mesenteric artery
is is through the left medial visceral rotation which will which will
show the entire pair visceral segment of the order including {[}00:33:00{]}
for centimeter two of the superior mesenteric artery If If more exposure
needs to be um you know if if one is trying to expose more distal
segments of the SFA then one probably have to go back to the anterior
approach not the left mijo visceral rotation and go through the approach
And in this case then the the superior mesic Terrick artery is of course
closely related to the head of the pancreas And and and and and so in
this situation that the head of the pancreas Well it needs to be you
knowdivided or you know the the SMA is closely adherent to the head of
the pancreas in this case distal of the segment of the superior
mesenteric artery distal to the pancreas is often now best seen in an
infra And these a call like approach And this this is the superior
mesenteric artery exits the second segment and its relation with the
{[}00:34:00{]} pancreas and comes out into the the root of the mesentery and
into the into the the small bowel This is where for example Mmm Mmm One
with lift the transverse colon cephalad as we described beforeand and
retract the small bowel to the patient's right and see the the the root
of the SMA below and and inferior to the to the transverse colon So yes
there there are these stink segments of the superior mesenteric
arteryexpose Each of those segments um has a little bit of a different
anatomic approach And and then and each of those segments hasyou know I
think considerations that are important that relate to surrounding
structures you know whether that's the obviously the pancreas the root
of the transfers colon

\textbf{Kevin:} thank you for taking us through those complicated anatomy of
the SMA as it kind of traverses the abdomenyou know in {[}00:35:00{]} all of
these vessels obviously we you know primary repair is kind of our our
our first option if possible And then many times you may need to
interposition graftJust you know I know this is a question that is very
case dependent is there a portion of the SMA that you can lie gate and
or is a is SMA just a no

ligation zone throughout

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Well that's a great question AndI think similar to other
other large axial vessels or arteriesyou know the more distal segments
is just going to be better tolerated than like eating the you know the
proximal proximal segments So um You know I would not say it's a no
ligation zone in its throughout its entiretybut I do thinkyou know that
if possibleefforts should be maintained or efforts should be undertaken
to maintain flow through the SMA through you know through through its
entiretyand you know repairing the SMA {[}00:36:00{]} just it depends upon
the injuryif it is a small grazing Wound Then then you know perhaps a
primary repair can be undertaken with a FORO or a five O proline
sutureum if it's a more substantial wound um and and one can get it
controlledand and isolate it you know than than repair can be Um
Undertaken with a patchy angioplasty or even an interposition graft
That's pretty rare And because those wounds are just so mortal um it's
very different You know patients who have those sorts of axial injuries
at the proximal portions of these message check vessels typically don't
surviveum And so you know it's very difficult I I can't think of a time
when I've necessarily been repairing for trauma the proximal segment or
two of of the SMA it's a little bit different for an elective tumor
resection atherosclerotic occlusive disease and such But for
trauma{[}00:37:00{]} Um you know it's it's it's pretty uncommon to be doing
extensive repair of of these SMA segments I don't I don't know what your
experience is or our thoughts are on that

\textbf{Adham:} I certainly have had zero experience preparing SMA injuries
Um but

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah I think it's just pretty uncommon

\textbf{Adham:}I know that like you said in her position grafting is probably
more theoretical than realistic in a situation like this But can you
talk about the technique for it Maybe it may be useful for other types
of situations but what what what material are you using where you're
where you're bringing the graph from and how you tunnel it

\textbf{Kevin:} I was just going to say I think you guys are exactly right
And and and Adam and I both experienced this is yeah many times we're
not seeing traumas with these injuries but many times we're getting
called by the surgical oncologist with a kind of can't cancer injury to
these vessels And so I think when we're discussing SMA we can kind of
keep it in the perspective of how do we replace it if we need to Um and
in the situation where they need to do some larger sections So with that
in mind a doctor asked {[}00:38:00{]} can W can you tell us how you would
bypass it

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah So I think that theI think that in these cases you
know and as I said in a rare situation in the setting of trauma if
you've if you've or able to establish proximal and distal control and
side-branch control of this segment and then you know your options for
reconstructing it um with an interposition graftyou know would would
include using a prosthetic like PTFE or Dacron or an autologous tissue
like vein And here it it just it depends it depends on how prepared you
know you are with the with patient for example as a patient prepped
where the one could harvest either the very proximal segment of greater
saffron is Fein or or a segment of deep femoral vein which which
mayactuallyYou know have a better size match to the proximal portions of
the SMA Um and and if that's the {[}00:39:00{]} case you know if there's
Interra contamination either from a tumor resection or from an injury
than it is preferable of course to to use autologous conduit such as
deep vein deep femoral vein a small segment of deep femoral vein or if
the if the saphenous at its proximal extent is It's large enough you can
one can use thatif that's not possible for example the leg isn't prepped
or or the expertise that is not available to to harvest the deep vein
then I think using a small segment of rifampin soaked Dacron graft would
be probably what I would useand you know you get some rifampin from the
pharmacy you get a probably a six or eight millimeter Diameter a segment
of Dacron and that's your inner position graph as far as tunneling it
that and and and how to route it That sort of depends upon the
injuryobviously the the the proximal most segments of The {[}00:40:00{]} SMA
are you know right underneath the pancreasif if this involves for
example a Whipple procedure where the head of the pancreas has got to
come out and and and with that approximal portion of the SMA then um you
know then then that's probably gonna require a six or eight millimeter
diameter interposition graft you know to replace that And And if it's
more distal and the SMA and now it's you know in the infra means a colic
The transverse colon is off and you're and they end up in the injury or
the the segment is is for examplebelowthe the the transverse colon and
that's going to be you know three or four millimeters and it may be
there that vein you know sadness pain would would work or in some of
those cases a patch angioplasty using vein is actually

easier and better than than trying to do an interposition graft to sort
of debris the the injury and then and then do a patch angioplasty using
a segment of a saphenous vein

\textbf{Adham:} All right One follow up questionin these situations with SMA
{[}00:41:00{]} injuries so you were a parent and the bowel doesn't look
infarcted or threatened at the time Do you think it's mandatory to leave
these patients open and do a second look even if everything is fine on
the first timedo you think you can kind of take it on a case by case
basis

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah I think and I think you're getting at a a an
important point here which is one we've emphasized throughout our
discussion is that none of these these procedures these these techniques
that we're describing take place in isolation right They they they have
to be in conjunction with anesthesia and an assessment of the patient's
physiology And And the whole team including the intensive care unit team
et cetera So it's a really good pointMy own preference in these
situations is to leave the leave the abdomen open with a temporary
abdominal closure of some sort and plan a look Um you know 24 to 36
hours later I I really That I thinkit I think we know that the morbidity
of {[}00:42:00{]} of that approach is is very low I suspectyou know um I
think it probably provides not just reassurance but probably some real
advantages in case the the the perfusion actually is not adequate and
the patient becomes acidemic and the bowel is compromised you know
subsequent to To a pure initial departure from the or

\textbf{Kevin:} Great And just to breeze through the inferior mesenteric
artery would you agree that you can generally like gate this with
impunity if it's damaged in a trauma

situation

\textbf{Rasmussen:}I think never say like eight with impunitybut I because
there's always situations whereYou know I think it has to be thoughtful
a ligation and in this case yes I think the majority of times the the
inferior mesenteric artery can be ligatedI think the thoughtful approach
here is to make an assessment as of to the patency of the iliac vessels
and specifically the internal iliac vessels I think if What we're
{[}00:43:00{]} describing which is ligation of the inferior mesenteric
artery one can be more assured that that's going to be tolerated if both
internal iliac arteries are patent for exampleif the SMA is paid and the
celiac is paid and then then the inferior mesenteric artery is almost
always tolerated Um if for some If it's an aged person who's got
occluded internal iliacs or they've got atherosclerosis lucid disease
and their mesenteries are not good then I think you have to be a little
worried about ligating the Ima in some cases

\textbf{Kevin:} Right And just for residents that'll be rounding I think we
generally discuss when talking about the Ima and you know open aorta
situations if it's occluded Or it's pulsatile then we feel comfortable
like eating it It's when it has that kind of a slight dribble back that
we may consider re implanting itjust to kind of prepare you for your
roundsdr SPC and we're going to jump into the last vessel of branches
{[}00:44:00{]} of the aorta Not an easy one to discuss either we're going to
get the renal arteriesandYou know I I know it differs kind of whether
it's proximal or distal it very much as far as your exposurebut how how
do you think of the renal arteries in your management of them in a
traumatic situations

\textbf{Rasmussen:} think that it'sI think that what I'm thinking about in
that question isIs similar these other vessels that thatand and
hopefully it's helpful as a broad principle and an approach you knowwe
started this discussion talking about exposure and making sure
communicate with anesthesia and you know having the right suction
devices and retracting devices and headlights in these broad concepts to
make sure that you you've thought about um going into these casesyou
know I think um when it comes to the renal arteries like like all these
festivals um it's useful to think well I'm either in a in a fairly
elective situation you know meaning I've got things under control for
the moment Patient's physiology is a {[}00:45:00{]} solid um you know
there's there's whatever bleeding there is is controlled and I I've got
a reasonable exposure in contrast toI am in a uncontrolled situation and
there's the patients in a in a really bad situationyou know the bleeding
is not controlled I don't know where the bleeding is coming from et
cetera And I think because it helps one toHave a mindset about whether
I'm pursuing damage control surgery you know am I going to have to how
how much am I going to work to maintain a patency of this vessel or am I
going to be more tolerant of litigating it and just as a damage
controlman over and having to deal with the consequences but recognizing
I need to do it to say the patient's life So the renal arteries are like
that I think because it is similar to the SMA it is pretty unlikely in
the setting of trauma to be reconstructing a renal artery I think that's
pretty rare in trauma that the kidney the renal artery is
either{[}00:46:00{]} Not injuredyou know not injured And you know there's
there's hematoma that is from the parenchyma of the kidney or
surrounding vessels or the renal artery is injured and Broncos you know
and and And if it's certainly if it's injured in thrombose by the time
you know an individual gets to it it's probably too late The scheming
time or mosquito time to the kidney's been too great and there's not
going to be value of of of trying to reconstruct it in the setting of
trauma And so if it happens to be an in between and I say well let's say
that a actually it is one of these cases where you know explore the The
the zone two hematoma and a is coming from a main renal arterythen you
know and there's flow in it but it's bleeding Then I think the
principles that we have described such as either primary repair four or
five Oh potentially probably in this case maybe a six O monofilament
sutures such as proline It would be useful if that appears to {[}00:47:00{]}
compromise the lumen andeither a patch angioplasty of that artery or you
know a bypass But again that is extremely rare in the setting of
traumayou know if it's going to require more than than a primary
repairyou know it's I think in my experience equally likely that you
know you're going to beligating that vessel for damage control

Um but but it's pretty rare to be doing a complex renal artery repair in
the setting of of trauma similar to the proximal SMA injuries for
example

It just pretty rare

\textbf{Adham:} right Can you talk to us about your emotions You're dealing
with your renal hematomas whether they're Penetrating or blind I know
the old adage of every penetrating renal hematoma should be explored and
blood one should not be explored unless they're expanding May not be
true but can you kind of walk us through how you approached this

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Right So you know zone two this would be a you know zone
one or the central dominal hematomas and you know the rules that
{[}00:48:00{]} you're alluding to or that you know almost all or all zone
one hematomas should be exploredZone two hematomas which are the kidneys
in the lateral gutters\\
basicallyyou know the the the general rule is that if it's a expanding
hematoma regardless if the mechanism is blunt or penetrating then those
hematomas Should be explored in zone two Um the general rule goes as
most of your listeners know if it's a blunt injury and the zone two
hematoma is not expanding then that does not need to be exploredIn
contrast if it's a zone to hematoma from a penetrating mechanism then
most of the time though than need to be explored even if the hematomas
is stable Those are the general rules that we we use to guide our
approach to zone two a retroperitoneal or zone to retroparotoneil
hematoma So I use those I think that's those are pretty goodYou know I I
think there are times {[}00:49:00{]} when a blunt you know one finds
themselves in in in in the belly because there was a hemoperitoneum from
a another injury And and and and there is a blunt mechanism and there's
a zone two hematoma I have explored those in the past And I think that
if I don't think those guidelines are meant to be You know a dictums
that can never beadjusted for an individual case I'm not sure if that

\textbf{Kevin:} So one question I know a lot of times many of these cases we
don't already have the laparotomy performed Um you know they're in the
trauma Bay They get a CT scan and they they call and say there's an
intimal flap There's a fistula maybe a pseudo aneurysm and the renal
artery any kind of general principles for

some of these sort of

incidental findings

\textbf{Rasmussen:} and I think that's a that's probably a so what you
described there is is the most obviously I guess the most common
scenario in which which which it's a The CT finding you know right in or
just after the resuscitation room of a of a of a main {[}00:50:00{]} renal
artery injury branch renal artery injury or maybe you know parenchymal
injury to the kidneyand in those casesI think if the let's say it's the
intimal flap that you described If the intimal flap is Either not Mateen
and there's perfusion in the kid on that CT scan for exampleand it does
not appear to be flow limiting then that can be observed some of those
like other blond arterial injury some of those will healif it is
amenable to an endovascular placement of a bare metal stent that Can be
used in some institutions to tack downor stabilize that detection Um and
that will be if if if you really feel like it is a flow limiting more
than 50\% stenosis caused by that intimal flap the more distal branch
artery injuries can often also be managed with endovascular techniques
such as {[}00:51:00{]} coil embolization Replacement of an occlusive you
know hemostat coil or other deviceand I think coil embolizing or or or
treating those depends uponyou know how the patient is doing how much
blood they're requiring how large the hematoma isand then what their
hemodynamics arebut I think for those reasons what we described five or
10 minutes ago um having to fix these main these these renal artery
injuries in the ORs pretty uncommon because they've either been
diagnosed and managedbased off CT with or without endo Endovascular
technologies and oftentimes the management of a renal artery injury If
you're in the or exploring and expanding you know hematoma and one of
the zone twos is is going to be nephrectomy you know because it's it's
that major injury in which there's just not there's not the {[}00:52:00{]}
indication for

repair

\textbf{Adham:} all the ranches of the aorta from the diaphragm Down to the
renals and Ima And I want to thank you very very much for taking a
complex topic and it's sort of convoluted in breaking it down from
technical steps to algorithms for exposure to how to repair I think this
was overall an excellent episode Well we haven't touched on the
endovascular management of trauma which we'll save for another
episodebut thank you so much for for a great discussion I for recipes

\textbf{Rasmussen:} well I applaud you for tackling this topic is unruly you
know it both in the the anatomy the anatomic exposure operative exposure
and then the seemingly endless number of scenariosThat can be considered
for either observation repair or damage control ligation I mean it's a
it's a it's a complex topic I would commend you for tackling it and I
hope that our discussion is is useful for for you and

and your listeners

\textbf{Kevin:} {[}00:53:00{]} Definitely I think this gives people the the
groundwork to really make some safe decisionsone thing I want to mention
to our listeners if you click on our show notes or you go to audible
bleeding.com we're going to have links to different YouTube videos that
will have breakdowns of many of these exposures so you can listen to
this and then go watch it later to really reinforce itso thank you dr

\textbf{Kevin:} {[}00:00:00{]} welcome back to another collaboration between
behind the knife and audible bleeding Today we're going to be covering
vascular trauma with our host Dr.~Todd Rasmussen I'm sorry with our
guest Dr.~Todd Rasmussen Dr.~Rasmussen is a Colonel the United States
air force and professor of surgery and Associate Dean of research at the
uniform services university of health sciences and an attending vascular
surgeon at Walter Reed national military medical center A couple of
weeks ago he helped us out with the peripheral vascular trauma and today
he's going to take us through abdominal vascular trauma thank you dr
recipes for joining us again on this collaborative podcast

\textbf{Rasmussen:} You bet Thank you for the opportunity and the
congratulations to you and your team on creating such a useful
information sharing venue So I'm pleased to be with you{[}00:01:00{]}

\textbf{Kevin:} Absolutelyand we also have a ad hum A muesli on the podcast
He's a chief resident at Cornell and a one of the team members of
audible bleeding So welcome

Adam

\textbf{Adham:} Yeah Thanks I'm excited to be here for this one

\textbf{Kevin:}so for the sake of time we're going to skip the preoperative
workup and description of anatomy and zones of abdominal vascular trauma
So please review this kind of on your own Um and just as a side note
we're also going to skip the management of iliac artery injuries We
covered that as part of our peripheral vascular trauma talk It can fit
into abdominal vascular trauma but for the sake of time we're going to
just jump into a true abdominal vascular trauma So we're gonna start out
with a little scenario just to kind of get our feet wet hereso doctor
asks me it's in a you have a patient with a gunshot wound to the abdomen
A general surgery has already prepped them from the neck to the knees
and performed a laparotomy from the xiphoid to the pubis They pack the
abdomen and temporarily have control on what they said was pulsatile
bleeding from zone one can you take us through how to get a super celiac
control And in a case like this and in a trauma

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Sureso I think you know I think for cases like this
{[}00:02:00{]} just a couple of starter pointsyou know no case like this
Should proceed without you know close communication with the entirety of
the resuscitation team So I think if I was coming into a case like this
or participated in a case like this with you know with our team I would
start by making surethat I was on good terms with my anesthesia
colleagues that they knew what we were um facing in this in this
situation that they were pursuing all the key tenants of damage control
resuscitation and and and all that That means meaning you know leading
with a blood product or whole blood resuscitation keeping the patient
warm and and all of those tenants So I would start with thatand I think
as far as technicallythe from a technical standpointin these types of
cases I will almost always you can't so what you can't see and I'll I'll
often really immediately assess my exposure I mean meaning the
laparotomy {[}00:03:00{]} So you mentioned thatLaparotomy in this case was
from the to the pubis And and and that's a great start Butbut for the
approach that you have referenced is likely to be needed in this case um
I'll often reset and actually come up a higher go between the and the
costal margin and almost begin you know two to three centimeters of Of a
of a sternotomy It's not a sternotomy but it is at least coming along
the SciFest side of the xiphoid and really release thoracic the inferior
costal margins of the thoracic under the diaphragm so that she can
really pull the diaphragm I mean sorry the cost of margins laterally and
up so that you want to suspend your costal margins so that you're almost
suspending the patient's rib cage up in a way from the aorta and the
abdominal contents So I think making a good assessment of your exposure
initially really important Hopefullyyou know {[}00:04:00{]} in in in the
case that I am prepping and in an operate on these cases I'll try as
best I can to use a retractor Such as thethat will allow for retractors
to really be placed up underneath the costal margin So again you can
spread spread those costs origins and try to lift the thoracic almost
lift the cost of margins away from the abdominal contents If if you
don't have an Omni you can still make sure that you're trying to OSE and
suspend thatum superior most aspect or cuddle Or cranium aspect of
yourof your exposure Once that's done And the other part of
communicating with anesthesia is to see if they have a nasal gastric
tube downsuper celiaccontrol of or in this case is almost always
facilitated byhaving a nasal gastric tube in the esophagus to allow one
to two You know to pop esophagus umin this area and and then be able to
get around that esophagus circumferentially and sometimes place some
sort of {[}00:05:00{]} umbilical tape or sometimes a Penrose drain to allow
for apt left sided Retraction of the esophagus away from the the a
cruise that's surrounding the aorta The other areas is really mobilizing
the left lateral segment of the liverso that that can either be brought
cephalad or tucked you know once it's mobilized can be Tucked in in area
early and brought to the right side or the whole portion of the liver so
that you've got the left lateral segment out of the way And now at this
point you know one is left with the cruise that's overlying the aorta
The other maneuver here sometimes dependent upon the situation is is put
into patient a little bit of reverse Trendelenburg to let the stomach
and and pull that stomach the inferiorally so that you create as big a
window as you can Oh with the esophagus retracted to the patient's left
the stomach kind of pulled down Sometimes you can have a resident or a
an assistant put their hand on the {[}00:06:00{]} stomach and retract it
towards the pelvis if you will Sometimes a little bit of reverse T-Bird
helps with that and you can kind of hopefully picture this So now you've
got the separated you've really The cost of margin suspended and now
you've got a window in which you can work And and at this point now it's
maneuvers dividing the skeletal muscle which is the cruise overline the
aorta This can often facilitated with a large right ankleyou know in a
Bovie extenderand you know in this case you know you can almost always
see that you're dividing skeletal muscle over the aorta if there's a
pulse hopefully there's even a weak pulse you know one can feel the
aorta and just divide the cruise over the aorta and and try to do some
blood dissection on either side to allow your patient of the spineOn
either side you know in these cases I typically don't try to spend time
getting circumferential control of the aorta It's not like an elective
aneurysm control So or elect bang chrism {[}00:07:00{]} repair where we'll
sometimes get round the entire order and these cases if you can get on
their side of the aorta down fineyou know that that is is is what is
needed and and is most efficient in these emergent sort of cases So up
there if you have other questions I mean it's a it's a unexposed which
requires you know a comprehensive set of of of things to think about But
I'll I'll

stop there for now

Do you have any

questions or comments

\textbf{Adham:} Somy question is sometimes you're faced with a situation of
entering a patient sad them and obviously there's a large rush of blood
and you think it may be coming from somewhere in the upper aorta Do you
think it's worth taking the time to get super Celia and control in the
in the way that you described before doing a video this rotation and
exposing the order that way Or are there any scenarios in which you
should do a medial visceral rotation first before you do that So take us
through can you take us through a {[}00:08:00{]} medial visceral rotation
When did she to want to leave the kidney down when to take it off sort
of the falls and advantages of doing each of those approaches

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah I think so That's a great question I think It is
worth getting super celiac control If in the scenario that you described
where where you you know the description is a zone one a hematoma that's
bleedingandyou know you you've got some a little bit of time you know
somebody may be holding pressure or but I do think it's worth getting
super celiac control if you think it's from the zone one Now if it's you
know the initial description was on one and then you get in there and
you look and it's actually it looks to be from the spleen or or from a
different area then then you can readjust But if it's truly a a a zone
one hematoma that's got active bleeding then I to answer your question I
do think it's worth taking the time to get super celiac controlthe
medial visceral rotation of courses {[}00:09:00{]} is designed to to to to
give upyou know optimal exposure to the left medial visceral rotation is
is designed to give optimal exposure of of the para visceral segment of
the aorta Sothat is you know the the the super celiac segment all the
way down to You know to the aortic bifurcation and and and and really
the left primarily the left iliac common iliac artery initially although
it can be taken across the ORIC bifurcation to see the right iliac as
well in this case that that is performed through dividing the white line
of told along the sigmoid sigmoid colon and the left colonand you know
establishing this plane and the retroperitoniumand and a good portion of
this is is steadyyou know blunt dissection it's facilitated with Bovie
electrocautery But it it is also um you know there's a plane in that in
this area that is developed with with with blood {[}00:10:00{]} to section
as well And in the setting of traumaalmost always this this detection
plane is taken from the sigmoid the left colon up to divide the the
attachments and grained the spleen and and the left kidney all the way
to the to the midline and then to the patient's right ultimatelyand I
think in in the setting of trauma the kidney is Almost always brought up
into this and and and just bring the kidney up I think it's generally
easier It's a little bit faster because you don't have to take the time
to to find that plane you know above the left kidney and to leave it
down in the setting of trauma Um I would almost always bring that left
kidney up

\textbf{Kevin:} Okay

\textbf{Rasmussen:} if that's yeah

\textbf{Kevin:} Yeah I think that's perfect one question I have is it seems
like the spleen is always getting in the way and always bleeding at the
end of one of these rotations Do you have any tips for managing bleeding
from the spleen

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Well I think thisgoes back to I think my initial comments
and and probably one of the key tenants of of this type of a procedure
is exposure and making sure that if you're going to undertake this that
you've really Gotcha Retractor you've got your incision up along the
alongside not just to the XY FOI but along side the XY Floyd and the
cost of margin so that you can really bring that the left cost of margin
both of them and suspend it up Because I think and in many cases what
you described is a result of just not being able to see welland soyou
know I think the the best I would the best tip I could give is is to
really try to make sure that that your exposure is as best you can and
if you're compromising on exposure um you knowwhich which is easier said
than done I I understand that But if you feel like you're compromising
on exposure or retraction that is that that's I think a contributor

to to

to splenic

injury

\textbf{Adham:} I have a question Speaking of exposure specifically about
eviscerating the battle I find myself as the as the senior residents
sometimes appreciating actually having difficult and nuances to do this
The way that I've learned to do it is kind of taking all the bowel and
finding a lap pad large {[}00:11:00{]} enough that's moist I'm placing some
sort of clamp or something around it and then having someone hold it
outside the abdomen but I've always found that it sort of ends up being
clunky or the bowel falls out of the time Do you have any tips on how to
eviscerate and control the small balance situation like this

\textbf{Rasmussen:} That's a great question And it is it's it is very
difficult to describe this using in a discussion It's one of those
things where you just got to feel it But in my experience this is the
and I hope those who are listening and you can kind of picture yourself
in the situation This is really the the the the main Purview and job of
the surgeon that's on the patients right So you can picture in a you're
on the patient's rights and and it takes a it takes ait takes a strong
and and I think big I don't necessarily mean physical but it takes a
strong and a big right hand to get that bowelthatyou know Often and over
{[}00:12:00{]} and to the patient's right side you're you know you're
pulling it from the left to the right And and I you know I'm sitting
here to describing it and my hand is I'm trying to extend my hand as
wide as I can you know and and it's it's not a subtle move It's notit it
shouldn't be a rugged but it needs to be very it can't be done with a
gentle it's Until a type of thing you've gotta be strong with it And I
don't use in this situation I'll get operative towels I'll ask them to
moisten blue towel or wet blue towel And you know basically what you do
is with you know with your left hand as you take that blue towel and you
put it underneath your right hand which has the viscera in it and you
know you sort of You tried to get it down at the base so that you really
that blue towel here and your right fingers are coming across the aorta
you knowcause you're taking it from the you know from the patient's left
to the patients to the midline and then {[}00:13:00{]} try to get it over to
the right and then put this big blue towel this wide blue towelyou know
underneath your fingers and then you know lay it out and and then
hopefully I mean this is where I I actually like in my situation or in
my preferences to use the Omni but you're going to need big a wide you
know retractor that's going to take the place of your right hand That's
going to now come in on the top of that blue towel And and hold all of
that and maybe a couple that hold that visceral you know to the patient
to the right of

the patient's Midland

\textbf{Adham:} That's one of those maneuvers that I feel like is very much
easier said than them and I've been

humbled by it

\textbf{Rasmussen:} it's very difficult to describe

\textbf{Adham:} I want to just ask a follow up question about the middle of
the medial visceral rotation that I asked her My question just to
clarify question is is there ever a situation in which you're faced with
a bleeding error where because of the time it takes to get super sealing
I control that you would rather do a visceral rotation and be controlled
being on it that way Or is your approach always Basically without fail
too if you have a high aortic injury to get your con control and then
immediately rotate the viscera and expose the order that way Secondly

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Well I think there'sgreat question I mean I think that if
youthere there are scenarios where if you if you If you feel like you
know you see the bleeding let's sayyou know it's zone one and all of a
sudden you you know you're getting ready to do this and you see that it
is a spurter from the SMA you know a superior mesenteric artery and it
doesn't look like it's the aorta for example And because there's some
structures of course in zone one that aren't I mean obviously they're
not some are not the aorta So I think that the scenario that you
wouldforego super celiac control would be a scenario in which you you
made an observation that you felt like you saw the bleeding It wasn't
necessarily from the aorta and you felt like you could kind of get it
controlled Locally you know without having to occlude a inflow from the
aorta So but thatif it's unknown you know and you have the you had just
you don't know where it's coming from in zone one I think short of that
I wouldadvocate for trying to get a super celiac control

\textbf{Kevin:} Greatso when we talked to the left medial this rotation for
our kind of med students out there we're we're thinking that there's
likely an aortic injury or a a a branch close off the aorta Um sometimes
you'll need to do a right medial visceral rotation thoughand that's
generally when you're kind of worried about eithergenerally a {[}00:14:00{]}
IVC injuryso Dr said can you just take us through a few of the nuances
of a right medial Chris rotation

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Right So this isyou know this from obviously from the
other side and this involves dividing the the White line of tollstarting
often at the and the coming along the right colon and bringing theyou
know the Sikh cephalad and and and the entire right colon you know to
the patient's left now and then cephalad it's I'm surprised most of the
time in these cases it's actually Not so much a rotation to the mid line
and then the left as it is bringing everything up cephalad to almost to
the patient's left costal margin for example They really are almost
bringing the CQM and the and the right colonYou know to the up onto the
patient's left chest in a way and and this is a plane that also similar
to the medial visceral rotation on the left {[}00:15:00{]} side This is a
plane that is largely developed with blunt dissection It's a combination
Once the the The parent Niamh retroperitoneum has been opened with with
some Bovie electrocautery than than the plane should develop And in this
case you'll see almost immediately the the left iliac vein and then the
vena cava And and you continue to bring the the left colon up until you
see the the left renal vein or I'm sorry the right renal vein and and
the kidney AndAnd and you know it did it's superior extent This willof
course expose the head of the pancreas the duodenum and the head of the
pancreas Andsimilarly um You know this the visitor in this situation I
get a a wet blue towel or operating towel I guess it can be white towel
but I don't really like to use a lap sponge cause it's too small and it
doesn't quite have enough substance And you will one willyou know place
that that {[}00:16:00{]} Blue operative towel down along your fingers that
are bringing this this all of the vis are up so that you really get it
all partitioned away with with a substantive operative toweland that
that has to be then you know cold in with a large retractors so that
your hands are free to actually operate

\textbf{Kevin:} Perfect one thing I just want to remind some of our residents
in medicines out there is I I would really go onto YouTube after this
and just look up left and right middle vis rotation that'll really help
solidify these points It's one thing hearing it but I think if you watch
some videos on it I think it'll really help bring it all togetherand if
you also want to

hear

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah I think I was going to say the same or to obviously
have an Atlas but are you know something because it's it is you got to
kind of combine I think the word that we're talking about here with with
some sort of visual aid the end the thing that I would recommend and
make a point is for those who have the opportunity to assist with spine
exposures So in these maneuvers that {[}00:17:00{]} we often perform as
assisting our orthopedic or neuro surgical colleagues to expose do
anterior exposure to the spine many of these maneuvers we're talking
about are performed in the spine exposure which which sometimes can be
overlooked by trainees And and and even They sometimes is well that's
not a very good operation You don't really get to so and and it's not
really a basket operation Boy I'll tell ya Um high exposures are a great
way to begin to nerve or learn the tenants of of of rotating the
visceral either to the right to the left and exposing the
retroperitonium

\textbf{Adham:} I think alsoprocurements have been extremely helpful for
liver and kidneythis right sided rotation Is it usually the first step
of any procurement And then you're kind of seeing the entire intro part
IOM So it's also a very good opportunity to learn some anatomy

\textbf{Kevin:} Absolutely And

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Great point

\textbf{Adham:}we haven't discussed the infer renal aorta yet {[}00:18:00{]} I
think probably a slightly more straightforward approach but can you
discuss your technique for inferiority exposure and then talk about I'm
kind of coming across the renal vein when you can like gate it how to
get it out of the way things like that

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Right So the the mostYou know the most common and maybe
most straightforward exposure is what we refer to as a you know
transperitoneal and from he's a colleagueexposure of thethe infer renal
aorta you know this here again people who are listening and looking
either at a videos or oror an Atlas kind of recommend or recognize that
the infer music colleaguemeans that the transverse colon isreflected
cephalad andit's one of the first moves is to really hold up the
transverse colon um in the patient's abdomen and and drape it up You
know cephalad almost on the patient's costal margin And often you
{[}00:19:00{]} know I'll set initially set a retractor Now that also goes
into a big to me is is partitioned with a operative towel a moistened or
wet operative towel to get the transverse colon um and retracted
cephalad and then the next move is to divide the ligament of Treitzand
this to me is always also a maneuver that's led by the surgeon on the
patient's right Um whether that's the primary surgeon and the the
attending or resident however you're configured this this maneuver
dividing the ligament of Treitz and and getting the you know fourth
portion of the denim which is to the left of the midline in a dividing
that ligament of Treitz that peritoneum and and and bringing that over
to the patient's right is is the next move Um and and that begins this
Process of you know getting really the the bowel Nowin this case the the
left colon is left remains to the patient's left {[}00:20:00{]} but you're
bringing all all bowel to the patient's rightthis this is not a medial
visceral rotation of of the entirety of the viscera This is only
bringing the duodenum the fourth portion of the Dudina and all of the
small bowel Partitioning it to the patients Right And and this also
again if one can visualize this be done by the patient the surgeon to
the patient's right and the right side of the patient bringing that
small bowel all the way across This also takes a wide and broad and
strong hand This can't be done with I don't know how else to say it It's
just a broad and strong sort of maneuver with with the hand to bring
this across and then and then partition get another wet blue towel I
keep saying blue I guess it could be white but operative towel and Yeah
Put that towel over your fingers And you know as you bring the small
bowel over that's the infer renal aortayou know this {[}00:21:00{]}
positioning Then retractors one will you know at the most cephalad
extent of that exposure begin to see the left renal veinat the at the
root of the of the colon mesenteryand you know at the at the caudal most
portion of this you'll see the aortic bifurcation Um andyou know that's
that's sort of the extent of this Thethe the the left renal vein Mmm Hmm
Can be like if if it if it facilitates aorta control Um obviously if one
is going to locate the left renal vein it's it's optimal to leave thethe
branches of the left renal vein So the gonadal eh the the lumbar vein
which also often will drain the left kidney and then the the the gonadal
So if those are left intact dividing that left renal vein can usually be
accomplished without causing a significant detriment to the left kidneyI
will say that dividing the left renal vein is easier said than
{[}00:22:00{]} done I mean it's it is you know it's a thin wall structure
which of course can bleed significantly itself So you know these are all
Sort of decisions that have to be made depending upon what what Andrew
you're dealing with and and the extent of your exposure

\textbf{Adham:}I think one question I forgot to ask you earlier was I think
Infor renally they are it is a little bit easier to get around
completely input you know an umbilical tamper a vessel loop around But
like you mentioned earlier Super celiac area That's a lot harder to do
when sometimes the goal is not to always do that but you have tips on
how to do that Because again I'd been humbled by that I'm in a
procurement one time when the attending allowed me to try and get around
it and I tried to bluntly with my fingers to get around the posterior
Huerta and had a lot of trouble So do you have any tips about that

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Well I think this isI mean this is just takes um you know
experience and and and And and and time I mean I in my own mind as I see
this I I you know {[}00:23:00{]} this is a combination of sort of a little
bit of Metzenbaum scissors a little bit of kind of pushing you know
cause what you're trying to do is to to to to free the aorta from from
the connective tissue around it to get back to the spine You know
sometimes actually almost always I'll use a metallic Pediatric yang
cower That is sort of one of my the suction or dissection tools of
choice is is pediatric Yankauer which is small and profile It's got a
blunt tip It will you know it is a suction device And so that's
usefuland you know kind of this combination of pushing a little bit of
maths here and there Metzenbaum scissorsand and a little bit of feeling
with your finger so you can get that connective tissue aorta freed and
then you know you can begin one can begin toto you know use a right
angle a big right angle and and try to to you know to get underneath it
Obviously what you're looking for here in {[}00:24:00{]} part is is a Is
lumbar you know you're looking for the lumbar vessels which you know
those are the things you need to leave behind for at least by as we tell
our residents you know find the outside before you find the inside you
can find them outside before you find the inside of a lumbar Then you
can clip ityou know another I think very useful tool in this situation
is is having large Weck cliffs you know because you're not it's very
difficult to pass you know a silk to lie gate a lumbar And in these
situations a lot of times you know you need those large WEC medium to
large Weck clips to help you know get on either side of a of a lumbar
artery or vein

\textbf{Kevin:} Great one quick point back to their renal vein I kind of
picked this up just as fast past week is you can really get a lot of
mobilization on the renal vein just by ligating some of the smaller
branchesout distantly on it not even the gonadal but sometimes the
adrenal vein and a few of those veins And you can really get you know
five centimeters a {[}00:25:00{]} mobilization of that renal vein which
should give you enough distance to clamp Um But now we're going to go
intoeach vessel off the aorta I know this isn't exactly what you're
going to see in a trauma You don't have isolated celiac artery injury or
isolated SMA injury but just for the sake of learning we're going to
talk through each vessel and talk about the options of exposing it and
then repairing it So starting approximately a Dr.~Rasmussencan you
discuss what the best ways to see the celiac artery are andany options
for repairing it

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah So the you know the celiac arteryI guess the origin
of the celiac arterycan be seen either through the lesser SAC this is
again through you know an an sort of a I guess an anterior approach\\
through the stackand this is would likely be very similar to the
exposure we talked about with a super celiac aortic exposure where the
cause retracted you know caudally down towards the pelvis{[}00:26:00{]} and
um You know that opening lesser sack and pulling the stomach down and
and sort of getting the pancreas to come down That will expose then the
the origin of the first centimeter to the celiac artery If the proximal
segment of the celiac artery is injured and bleeding then then the
repair optionsyou know I I think lend into the category of any vascular
know major vascular three If it can be prepared repaired primarily then
you know using\\
four Oh five Oh proline future If it does a grazing wound and repairing
it primarily can be done then then that's that's one option if it's a
largeyou know\\
celiac artery injury that that cannot be repaired primarily and there's
destruction of the wall Oftentimes you're an individuals in a dam Really
a damage control situation there And repair is not so much Your first a
lot of thought You're {[}00:27:00{]} really situation trying to just control
bleeding and save patient's life And and so in those cases you know
controlling the celiac artery and even consider you know ligating it may
be necessaryyou know as a damage control maneuver at least initiallythe
other way to see the origin of the celiac artery is still left medial
visceral rotation So the maneuver we described before will show the
entire we'll expose the the para visceral segment of the aorta

um to include the first centimeter to the celiac artery

\textbf{Adham:} so any keys to identifying the common hepatic artery and
againthoughts on ligation strategies and repairs

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Right So I think the you know I think I mean the common a
paddock you'll need to that will not be able to be visualized through
the left medial visceral rotation that the common hepatic and getting
out into the {[}00:28:00{]} segments there of of the of the the major
branches of the celiac one we'll need then in that case to be coming
from a you know a transparent to Neal you know anterior approach with a
lesser SAC And you know di identifying the common a paddockyou know is
isMmm You know requires sort of a recognition of where the celiac artery
is You're in the lesser SAC The stomach really has to be Ah inferiorly
This is again if you find yourself operating in this space you know the
the the costal margins as I said to begin really have to be flared And
almost suspended upso that you've really opened this Sometimes reverse
Trendelenburg is useful getting a hand a resident or a med student's
hand to pull the stomach downand open up that that that spaceum it you
know that that will then should expose then the you know the the the
second and third segments of the celiac and its major branches to
include the common {[}00:29:00{]} hepatic artery

\textbf{Kevin:} Great And so as far as like getting the common hepatic artery
how does the GDA play into this And by that I mean the gastroduodenal
artery

\textbf{Rasmussen:} I mean you know the the the the GDA is as I guess is most
commonly the case is you know and and listeners know is Really one of
the first or the first branch of the common hepatic artery and and
really defines the junction between the common hepatic and proper
paddock arteriesand I thinkI mean ideally um The common hepatic should
should not ideally you don't want to legging any of these arteries right
So I think that we start with that premise to say geez if we can get a
repair done that's going to be our that's going to beoption awhether
that's the common hepatic proper paddock or GDA just like any artery in
the body like 18 it may be required as it is a damage control maneuver
just to control hemorrhage {[}00:30:00{]} let the patient recover a little
bit talk to anesthesia and sort of see how things are going Make an
assessment of of of the region distal to where you've liked it So so
this is just a basic tenant of like aiding any artery in a damage
control situation we recognize no matter which artery rely gating the
consequences of that ligation or we need to assess those consequences
and then and then address them if we're able if patients you know able
to um to move to the next step Soobviously liking the comment of paddock
distal to the GDA likely to Render you know a significant portion of the
of the duodenum the pancreas and and then the liver is schemicand so you
know if the light station can occur proximal if the injury is proximal
to the GDA um then you know that would and G and perfusion can be
maintained into the GDA then that's that's preferable{[}00:31:00{]}but if I
was in one of these situations or when I am And we find ourselves having
to like ate it or we like hated it We didn't quite know cause we didn't
but we had to you know I was bleeding and there was a clip when we had a
damage control overand now Jeannie or the common paddock or the proper
paddocks lie dated Now what I usually will talk to anesthesia We'll get
the patient as resuscitate as we can We'll get out the Doppler we'll
make an assessment because you know dependent upon patients can tolerate
but depending on the resuscitation status collateral where your legation
isyou know they may be able to tolerate having any one of those vessels
legged If on the other hand without your Doppler and you get the patient
resuscitate as possible and there's clear aschemia then you're going to
be faced with the decision whether or not we need a reconstruct the this
leg vessel shuntedor you know it may be situation where you have to deal
with the metabolic consequences and leave the {[}00:32:00{]} leave at like
eight There's not one answer You know that I think there's a there's not
one answer that applies to all situations It's a I think it's a learning
and adhering to the principles of damage control resuscitation and
damage control surgery

\textbf{Kevin:} Absolutelyso off the record dr real quick I think you miss
said the distal and proximal cause you can lie gate the you can like it
The common a paddock Proximal to the GDA because you'll have retrograde
flow from the GDA into the proper hepatic Rightcould you just say that
sentence and one more time and then

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Sure what I guess what I'm what I'm meant to say And I
don't you know actually looking at a diagram so I can try to see the so
what I meant to say is that you can often lie gait the common hepatic
proximal GDA keeping a retrograde filling into the GDA and maintaining a
viability of the Dudina and the pancreatic head

\textbf{Kevin:} Perfect Thank you Okay And now let's dive into the Um and
this is you know very close in proximity to the celiac artery So many of
the options to visualize it will be the same but there's some unique
differences A is with its relationship with the pancreas Um so briefly
doctor asked me Jason what are our options to see the SMA and and and do
we kind of think of SMA kind of in portions a little differently than
some

other vessels

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Definitely So the the SMAyou know the the the pathway
really to see the first centimeter to the SMA superior mesenteric artery
is is through the left medial visceral rotation which will which will
show the entire pair visceral segment of the order including {[}00:33:00{]}
for centimeter two of the superior mesenteric artery If If more exposure
needs to be um you know if if one is trying to expose more distal
segments of the SFA then one probably have to go back to the anterior
approach not the left mijo visceral rotation and go through the approach
And in this case then the the superior mesic Terrick artery is of course
closely related to the head of the pancreas And and and and and so in
this situation that the head of the pancreas Well it needs to be you
knowdivided or you know the the SMA is closely adherent to the head of
the pancreas in this case distal of the segment of the superior
mesenteric artery distal to the pancreas is often now best seen in an
infra And these a call like approach And this this is the superior
mesenteric artery exits the second segment and its relation with the
{[}00:34:00{]} pancreas and comes out into the the root of the mesentery and
into the into the the small bowel This is where for example Mmm Mmm One
with lift the transverse colon cephalad as we described beforeand and
retract the small bowel to the patient's right and see the the the root
of the SMA below and and inferior to the to the transverse colon So yes
there there are these stink segments of the superior mesenteric
arteryexpose Each of those segments um has a little bit of a different
anatomic approach And and then and each of those segments hasyou know I
think considerations that are important that relate to surrounding
structures you know whether that's the obviously the pancreas the root
of the transfers colon

\textbf{Kevin:} thank you for taking us through those complicated anatomy of
the SMA as it kind of traverses the abdomenyou know in {[}00:35:00{]} all of
these vessels obviously we you know primary repair is kind of our our
our first option if possible And then many times you may need to
interposition graftJust you know I know this is a question that is very
case dependent is there a portion of the SMA that you can lie gate and
or is a is SMA just a no

ligation zone throughout

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Well that's a great question AndI think similar to other
other large axial vessels or arteriesyou know the more distal segments
is just going to be better tolerated than like eating the you know the
proximal proximal segments So um You know I would not say it's a no
ligation zone in its throughout its entiretybut I do thinkyou know that
if possibleefforts should be maintained or efforts should be undertaken
to maintain flow through the SMA through you know through through its
entiretyand you know repairing the SMA {[}00:36:00{]} just it depends upon
the injuryif it is a small grazing Wound Then then you know perhaps a
primary repair can be undertaken with a FORO or a five O proline
sutureum if it's a more substantial wound um and and one can get it
controlledand and isolate it you know than than repair can be Um
Undertaken with a patchy angioplasty or even an interposition graft
That's pretty rare And because those wounds are just so mortal um it's
very different You know patients who have those sorts of axial injuries
at the proximal portions of these message check vessels typically don't
surviveum And so you know it's very difficult I I can't think of a time
when I've necessarily been repairing for trauma the proximal segment or
two of of the SMA it's a little bit different for an elective tumor
resection atherosclerotic occlusive disease and such But for
trauma{[}00:37:00{]} Um you know it's it's it's pretty uncommon to be doing
extensive repair of of these SMA segments I don't I don't know what your
experience is or our thoughts are on that

\textbf{Adham:} I certainly have had zero experience preparing SMA injuries
Um but

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah I think it's just pretty uncommon

\textbf{Adham:}I know that like you said in her position grafting is probably
more theoretical than realistic in a situation like this But can you
talk about the technique for it Maybe it may be useful for other types
of situations but what what what material are you using where you're
where you're bringing the graph from and how you tunnel it

\textbf{Kevin:} I was just going to say I think you guys are exactly right
And and and Adam and I both experienced this is yeah many times we're
not seeing traumas with these injuries but many times we're getting
called by the surgical oncologist with a kind of can't cancer injury to
these vessels And so I think when we're discussing SMA we can kind of
keep it in the perspective of how do we replace it if we need to Um and
in the situation where they need to do some larger sections So with that
in mind a doctor asked {[}00:38:00{]} can W can you tell us how you would
bypass it

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah So I think that theI think that in these cases you
know and as I said in a rare situation in the setting of trauma if
you've if you've or able to establish proximal and distal control and
side-branch control of this segment and then you know your options for
reconstructing it um with an interposition graftyou know would would
include using a prosthetic like PTFE or Dacron or an autologous tissue
like vein And here it it just it depends it depends on how prepared you
know you are with the with patient for example as a patient prepped
where the one could harvest either the very proximal segment of greater
saffron is Fein or or a segment of deep femoral vein which which
mayactuallyYou know have a better size match to the proximal portions of
the SMA Um and and if that's the {[}00:39:00{]} case you know if there's
Interra contamination either from a tumor resection or from an injury
than it is preferable of course to to use autologous conduit such as
deep vein deep femoral vein a small segment of deep femoral vein or if
the if the saphenous at its proximal extent is It's large enough you can
one can use thatif that's not possible for example the leg isn't prepped
or or the expertise that is not available to to harvest the deep vein
then I think using a small segment of rifampin soaked Dacron graft would
be probably what I would useand you know you get some rifampin from the
pharmacy you get a probably a six or eight millimeter Diameter a segment
of Dacron and that's your inner position graph as far as tunneling it
that and and and how to route it That sort of depends upon the
injuryobviously the the the proximal most segments of The {[}00:40:00{]} SMA
are you know right underneath the pancreasif if this involves for
example a Whipple procedure where the head of the pancreas has got to
come out and and and with that approximal portion of the SMA then um you
know then then that's probably gonna require a six or eight millimeter
diameter interposition graft you know to replace that And And if it's
more distal and the SMA and now it's you know in the infra means a colic
The transverse colon is off and you're and they end up in the injury or
the the segment is is for examplebelowthe the the transverse colon and
that's going to be you know three or four millimeters and it may be
there that vein you know sadness pain would would work or in some of
those cases a patch angioplasty using vein is actually

easier and better than than trying to do an interposition graft to sort
of debris the the injury and then and then do a patch angioplasty using
a segment of a saphenous vein

\textbf{Adham:} All right One follow up questionin these situations with SMA
{[}00:41:00{]} injuries so you were a parent and the bowel doesn't look
infarcted or threatened at the time Do you think it's mandatory to leave
these patients open and do a second look even if everything is fine on
the first timedo you think you can kind of take it on a case by case
basis

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Yeah I think and I think you're getting at a a an
important point here which is one we've emphasized throughout our
discussion is that none of these these procedures these these techniques
that we're describing take place in isolation right They they they have
to be in conjunction with anesthesia and an assessment of the patient's
physiology And And the whole team including the intensive care unit team
et cetera So it's a really good pointMy own preference in these
situations is to leave the leave the abdomen open with a temporary
abdominal closure of some sort and plan a look Um you know 24 to 36
hours later I I really That I thinkit I think we know that the morbidity
of {[}00:42:00{]} of that approach is is very low I suspectyou know um I
think it probably provides not just reassurance but probably some real
advantages in case the the the perfusion actually is not adequate and
the patient becomes acidemic and the bowel is compromised you know
subsequent to To a pure initial departure from the or

\textbf{Kevin:} Great And just to breeze through the inferior mesenteric
artery would you agree that you can generally like gate this with
impunity if it's damaged in a trauma

situation

\textbf{Rasmussen:}I think never say like eight with impunitybut I because
there's always situations whereYou know I think it has to be thoughtful
a ligation and in this case yes I think the majority of times the the
inferior mesenteric artery can be ligatedI think the thoughtful approach
here is to make an assessment as of to the patency of the iliac vessels
and specifically the internal iliac vessels I think if What we're
{[}00:43:00{]} describing which is ligation of the inferior mesenteric
artery one can be more assured that that's going to be tolerated if both
internal iliac arteries are patent for exampleif the SMA is paid and the
celiac is paid and then then the inferior mesenteric artery is almost
always tolerated Um if for some If it's an aged person who's got
occluded internal iliacs or they've got atherosclerosis lucid disease
and their mesenteries are not good then I think you have to be a little
worried about ligating the Ima in some cases

\textbf{Kevin:} Right And just for residents that'll be rounding I think we
generally discuss when talking about the Ima and you know open aorta
situations if it's occluded Or it's pulsatile then we feel comfortable
like eating it It's when it has that kind of a slight dribble back that
we may consider re implanting itjust to kind of prepare you for your
roundsdr SPC and we're going to jump into the last vessel of branches
{[}00:44:00{]} of the aorta Not an easy one to discuss either we're going to
get the renal arteriesandYou know I I know it differs kind of whether
it's proximal or distal it very much as far as your exposurebut how how
do you think of the renal arteries in your management of them in a
traumatic situations

\textbf{Rasmussen:} think that it'sI think that what I'm thinking about in
that question isIs similar these other vessels that thatand and
hopefully it's helpful as a broad principle and an approach you knowwe
started this discussion talking about exposure and making sure
communicate with anesthesia and you know having the right suction
devices and retracting devices and headlights in these broad concepts to
make sure that you you've thought about um going into these casesyou
know I think um when it comes to the renal arteries like like all these
festivals um it's useful to think well I'm either in a in a fairly
elective situation you know meaning I've got things under control for
the moment Patient's physiology is a {[}00:45:00{]} solid um you know
there's there's whatever bleeding there is is controlled and I I've got
a reasonable exposure in contrast toI am in a uncontrolled situation and
there's the patients in a in a really bad situationyou know the bleeding
is not controlled I don't know where the bleeding is coming from et
cetera And I think because it helps one toHave a mindset about whether
I'm pursuing damage control surgery you know am I going to have to how
how much am I going to work to maintain a patency of this vessel or am I
going to be more tolerant of litigating it and just as a damage
controlman over and having to deal with the consequences but recognizing
I need to do it to say the patient's life So the renal arteries are like
that I think because it is similar to the SMA it is pretty unlikely in
the setting of trauma to be reconstructing a renal artery I think that's
pretty rare in trauma that the kidney the renal artery is
either{[}00:46:00{]} Not injuredyou know not injured And you know there's
there's hematoma that is from the parenchyma of the kidney or
surrounding vessels or the renal artery is injured and Broncos you know
and and And if it's certainly if it's injured in thrombose by the time
you know an individual gets to it it's probably too late The scheming
time or mosquito time to the kidney's been too great and there's not
going to be value of of of trying to reconstruct it in the setting of
trauma And so if it happens to be an in between and I say well let's say
that a actually it is one of these cases where you know explore the The
the zone two hematoma and a is coming from a main renal arterythen you
know and there's flow in it but it's bleeding Then I think the
principles that we have described such as either primary repair four or
five Oh potentially probably in this case maybe a six O monofilament
sutures such as proline It would be useful if that appears to {[}00:47:00{]}
compromise the lumen andeither a patch angioplasty of that artery or you
know a bypass But again that is extremely rare in the setting of
traumayou know if it's going to require more than than a primary
repairyou know it's I think in my experience equally likely that you
know you're going to beligating that vessel for damage control

Um but but it's pretty rare to be doing a complex renal artery repair in
the setting of of trauma similar to the proximal SMA injuries for
example

It just pretty rare

\textbf{Adham:} right Can you talk to us about your emotions You're dealing
with your renal hematomas whether they're Penetrating or blind I know
the old adage of every penetrating renal hematoma should be explored and
blood one should not be explored unless they're expanding May not be
true but can you kind of walk us through how you approached this

\textbf{Rasmussen:} Right So you know zone two this would be a you know zone
one or the central dominal hematomas and you know the rules that
{[}00:48:00{]} you're alluding to or that you know almost all or all zone
one hematomas should be exploredZone two hematomas which are the kidneys
in the lateral gutters\\
basicallyyou know the the the general rule is that if it's a expanding
hematoma regardless if the mechanism is blunt or penetrating then those
hematomas Should be explored in zone two Um the general rule goes as
most of your listeners know if it's a blunt injury and the zone two
hematoma is not expanding then that does not need to be exploredIn
contrast if it's a zone to hematoma from a penetrating mechanism then
most of the time though than need to be explored even if the hematomas
is stable Those are the general rules that we we use to guide our
approach to zone two a retroperitoneal or zone to retroparotoneil
hematoma So I use those I think that's those are pretty goodYou know I I
think there are times {[}00:49:00{]} when a blunt you know one finds
themselves in in in in the belly because there was a hemoperitoneum from
a another injury And and and and there is a blunt mechanism and there's
a zone two hematoma I have explored those in the past And I think that
if I don't think those guidelines are meant to be You know a dictums
that can never beadjusted for an individual case I'm not sure if that

\textbf{Kevin:} So one question I know a lot of times many of these cases we
don't already have the laparotomy performed Um you know they're in the
trauma Bay They get a CT scan and they they call and say there's an
intimal flap There's a fistula maybe a pseudo aneurysm and the renal
artery any kind of general principles for

some of these sort of

incidental findings

\textbf{Rasmussen:} and I think that's a that's probably a so what you
described there is is the most obviously I guess the most common
scenario in which which which it's a The CT finding you know right in or
just after the resuscitation room of a of a of a main {[}00:50:00{]} renal
artery injury branch renal artery injury or maybe you know parenchymal
injury to the kidneyand in those casesI think if the let's say it's the
intimal flap that you described If the intimal flap is Either not Mateen
and there's perfusion in the kid on that CT scan for exampleand it does
not appear to be flow limiting then that can be observed some of those
like other blond arterial injury some of those will healif it is
amenable to an endovascular placement of a bare metal stent that Can be
used in some institutions to tack downor stabilize that detection Um and
that will be if if if you really feel like it is a flow limiting more
than 50\% stenosis caused by that intimal flap the more distal branch
artery injuries can often also be managed with endovascular techniques
such as {[}00:51:00{]} coil embolization Replacement of an occlusive you
know hemostat coil or other deviceand I think coil embolizing or or or
treating those depends uponyou know how the patient is doing how much
blood they're requiring how large the hematoma isand then what their
hemodynamics arebut I think for those reasons what we described five or
10 minutes ago um having to fix these main these these renal artery
injuries in the ORs pretty uncommon because they've either been
diagnosed and managedbased off CT with or without endo Endovascular
technologies and oftentimes the management of a renal artery injury If
you're in the or exploring and expanding you know hematoma and one of
the zone twos is is going to be nephrectomy you know because it's it's
that major injury in which there's just not there's not the {[}00:52:00{]}
indication for

repair

\textbf{Adham:} all the ranches of the aorta from the diaphragm Down to the
renals and Ima And I want to thank you very very much for taking a
complex topic and it's sort of convoluted in breaking it down from
technical steps to algorithms for exposure to how to repair I think this
was overall an excellent episode Well we haven't touched on the
endovascular management of trauma which we'll save for another
episodebut thank you so much for for a great discussion I for recipes

\textbf{Rasmussen:} well I applaud you for tackling this topic is unruly you
know it both in the the anatomy the anatomic exposure operative exposure
and then the seemingly endless number of scenariosThat can be considered
for either observation repair or damage control ligation I mean it's a
it's a it's a complex topic I would commend you for tackling it and I
hope that our discussion is is useful for for you and

and your listeners

\textbf{Kevin:} {[}00:53:00{]} Definitely I think this gives people the the
groundwork to really make some safe decisionsone thing I want to mention
to our listeners if you click on our show notes or you go to audible
bleeding.com we're going to have links to different YouTube videos that
will have breakdowns of many of these exposures so you can listen to
this and then go watch it later to really reinforce itso thank you dr
recipe set again for an extremely complex episode that you're breaking
down onto a podcast

Rich, MD, MPH; Todd Rasmussen, MD}

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} {[}00:00:00{]} Okay,
and welcome back to behind the knife and audible bleeding vascular
trauma podcasts with our guest, Dr.~Todd Rasmussen. Dr.~Rasmussen is a
Colonel in the United States air force, and he's a professor of surgery
and associate Dean of research at the uniform services university of
health science and an attending vascular surgeon at Walter Reed.

National military medical center. We're continuing our {[}00:01:00{]} series
today on vascular trauma. He is the editor of the riches vascular
trauma, and he's been gracious enough to join us and help us, , dive
into these discussions. Um, and today we actually have, , one of my
co-fellows and audible bleeding host, , Nicole Rich, , Nicole, thanks
for joining.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} Thanks for having me.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Um, all right,
Dr.~Rasmussen, , welcome back to audible bleeding.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Thanks a lot
for having me. I'm looking forward to, , to the discussion.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} So we just want
to start with some of the basics here. Um, for the tenants of managing
patients with suspected cerebrovascular injuries, um, what are some of
the principles we have to keep in mind when we, when we're called the
trauma Bay on a patient like this.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Well, I think
that, , there's, there's some, , of the key tenants that are very much
alike. I'm with the tenants of vascular injury, , and other anatomic
locations. Um, and then there's, there certainly are some unique facets
to cerebrovascular injury. That are different, , than, than other,
anatomic regions.

So, you know, I {[}00:02:00{]} think to begin with, um, the key tenants that
are, that are similar relate to, , bleeding control. So that if, , if it
is , in the cervical region or the region of cerebrovascular, , ,
trauma, there's active bleeding then, then of course, that, . , from the
vascular injury, then that takes precedent that we have to take measures
either with manual compression or, , other, other mechanisms to control
the bleeding and resuscitate the patient.

I think unlike other, um, vascular injury, , patterns, cerebrovascular
injury, or cervical, , vascular injury in the cervical region also, ,
can quickly compromise the airway. And so I think, . You know, those
making sure that there's control of, of, of catastrophic bleeding, , and
then making sure that, , that the vascular injury is not immediately
compromising the airway or are our two tenants that are

common with other vascular injury patterns and one is unique to this
area.{[}00:03:00{]} Um, and then I think also unique to this areas is, um,
the, the neuro status of the patient. , is the patient, um, awake or
Tundra or asleep, or is the patient awake? And does the patient have,
um, signs of hemispheric. stroke, , or ischemia.

Um, and I think depending upon, , the injury pattern and the, the
overall status of the patient, making a, , an assessment and being
particularly aware of the patient's neuro status, , in, in these
anatomic region is very important.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Definitely. So,
um, to highlight is in these patients, we want to prevent secondary
injury. Um, so, um, if they have a brain injury, um, we're going to. Do
everything we can to keep their blood pressure, prevent hypotension,
prevent hypoxia. And then like dr Rajistan and said, we really need to
make sure we have a good neuro exam.

as soon and as good of a neuro exam is as possible. Um, and I know the
situation's very, um,

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} . So Dr.~Rasmussen, can you
talk to us about what types of patients and what patterns of injuries
{[}00:04:00{]} should. , Clewis into a potential for blood carotid injury
when we should have a high index of suspicion.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Sure. I think
there, um, certainly are on the physical exam. , there are, there are
findings that will cue the provider, , to the high suspicion for, um. A
blunt carotid injury, um, most commonly is some sort of external Mark on
the neck, , or, , around the thoracic outlet of, , of the patient. Um,
for example, a seatbelt Mark, um, , or some sort of a choke Mark or
such.

So if there's external signs of injury, um. , around the, the color
region of the cervical region of the patient. That certainly should cue,
, the provider end. I think there's, there are, um, , I think other
findings on physical exam, um, if the patient is, has unilateral, ,
signs that suggest hemispheric ischemia or a stroke, um, I think that is
uncommon.

But I think that obviously. , if the patient's awake enough and is
demonstrating, um, um. Um, demonstrating physical {[}00:05:00{]} findings
that suggest a hemispheric aschemia or stroke. I think that certainly is
another, , another, um, finding that would cue someone in, , to looking
more closely for, , a blunt carotid injury.

I think the, the types of injuries, mechanisms of injury, I think I
mentioned the seatbelt injury, I mean, a car accident. Um, for, um, is,
is, is kind of a typical, , or common injury pattern in civilian
settings where, um, you know, the, the seatbelt itself has caused a, um,
, a blunt injury, , after or during a car accident.

So I think that is a mechanism of injury that should also, cue someone
in.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Yeah, and I think
for the behind the knife listeners that are listening, um, it's really
important to have this high index of suspicion because if you guys don't
identify these as the trauma surgeons, as the general surgeon on call,
these patients can have devastating outcomes. So really being. Alert and
aware for these patients with complex facial fractures, these closed
hit, closed head injuries, and the seatbelt signs can really save lives
and get the {[}00:06:00{]} appropriate imaging to help rule in or out a a
carotid injury.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} You know, you
mentioned, um, TBI or head injury, and I think that is, that's another
obviously very common. Mechanism and unis blunt. Carotid injury is
pretty rare. Um, I think as vascular surgeons or vascular. Trauma
specialists, we tend to see them more frequently cause we get called. ,
but for, for, um, those providers who are in the emergency department, ,
or are seeing you know, all forms of trauma and presentation.

I think a TBI, traumatic brain injury, um, , head injury and then
complex facial fractures, those, as you alluded to, are. You know, our
injury patterns where when you're looking both in examining the patient,
but then, you know, these days in particular, when you get the CT scan,
really paying attention to, you know, the cervical vasculature is, is,
is particularly important.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} Great. And then just a couple
other injuries that keep in mind for this type of, um, presentation as
{[}00:07:00{]} well would be , cervical vertebral body fractures or
transverse foramen fractures. And then also just in patients who've had
severe hyperextension rotation, reflection injuries of the neck.

Okay, great. So how do we classify and think about treating injuries
with, um, blunt credit injuries? What's our grading system and how does
that dictate how we manage these.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Well, I think
that as we think about this one thinks about, the anatomy of the vessel
wall, the arterial wall. that helps us conceptualize the degree or the
severity of, of these blood carotid injuries. They can be, um, as simple
as a, as an intimal tear, , where, um, you know, it is, the intimate has
been raised off of the media and it creates a minor flow defect.

, which may be prone to platelet aggregation. Um, but it's, it's not a,
, a long dissection and it's, it's not a flow limiting defect, and that
is the {[}00:08:00{]} most minor. , and then of course, the most severe on
the other end of the spectrum is a blond carotid injury. That's resulted
in. In, in complete thrombosis of the artery so that, , it's either the
vessel has been transected from the blunt injury and is thrombosis or, ,
or the, the injury is this, such that the intimate is lifted up and it
has created a longer this section that is, that is now thrombosed and
occluded the vessel.

And then there's the degrees of injury between those two extremes where.
There can be a longer does section, um, that, has thrombus associated
with it and is visible on the cat scan or the imaging modality, um, and
or, um, a dissection that can be flow limiting the defect that can be
flow limiting.

They may not have thrombus and it, or B along the section, but it, but
it is in itself flow limiting, meaning that it. It's, , compromises
greater than 50\%, for example, {[}00:09:00{]} of the, of the lumen of that
pestle. So, you know, the, the varying degrees of severity, um, you
know, with our imaging technologies today, mostly CTA, it is possible to
pick up, you know, or is.

If you're able to pick up or proceed the different, , types of severity
from a, again, from a real mild intimal defect that's not flow limiting,
that has no thrombus all the way to the more obvious, , you know, , ,
injury where there's complete thrombosis.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Is there any role
for ultrasound, , in addition to CTA, if you do see some sort of intimal
flap, , to maybe see the, if there's any hemodynamic impact of it, or is
it. Does CTA give you the information that you need.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} I think
that's a really good point. I love, I really like ultrasound. I think
you alluded to this, um, with your comment, you know, CT gives you,
gives one a static image. , it's often quite detailed and, , boy, I
really also think that CTA {[}00:10:00{]} is, I mean, in many ways it is the
gold standard, but it is a static image.

Yeah. In contrast, duplex ultrasound, which combines B mode, you know,
ultrasonography with POLST Doppler , gives one a real dynamic, um,
assessment of the area of interest. Meaning is, is the, um, is there, I
mentioned the word flow limiting is, is there a elevated velocity and a
detriment in, in, in.

Or a change or a difference in the velocities around that area. So I
think, I think you can get a lot of information with duplex though. Of
course, the limitation with duplex, and we may talk about this, um, when
we talk about the different zones of. Of of, of neck injury, you know,
the, the limitation with duplex is it, it you cannot see above the angle
of the mandible.

So you quickly kind of run out of real estate distally where you can use
duplex. It's not good for distal internal carotid injuries and you
cannot see, you know, proximal to the thoracic outlet. {[}00:11:00{]} So,
you know, there is a limited window in which duplex is useful. But, ,
but in that window, I think it gives really important information.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} That's a great point. So going
back to the grading of the injuries, , Dr.~Rasmussen, you described to
us a grade one and grade two injuries, which involve intimal injuries, ,
less than 25\% in grade one or grade two with a greater than 25\% luminal
narrowing. Um, can you talk about the management of grade one and two
injuries.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah, I think
I'm grade one and grade two injuries. Um. Most of the time are managed
non-operatively and can be managed expectantly with, , use of
antiplatelet therapy, potentially anticoagulation. Um, depending upon,
um, the patient's global burden of trauma. Do they have an associated
TBI? Do they have other, other injuries?

But. Um, if, if there are, if the patient is {[}00:12:00{]} neurologically
intact, um, and a grade one or grade two injury is seen on imaging, um,
and the patient is able to have anti-platelet or anticoagulation
therapy, then those, those types of great injuries, grade one and grade
two are managed. Non-operatively, , with, , I guess you'd say medical
management.

If the patient changes, meaning that he or she was initially
neurologically normal, um, and medical management is initiated and then
the patient changes has hemispheric symptoms indicating that your
medical management is failing. Then that is a situation where, , an
intervention is, is this likely to be needed or would be indicated, um,
if that makes sense.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} That drives me is
to have a question. Um, have you ever been in a situation where you have
a grade one or two injury, but a {[}00:13:00{]} patient that you're unable
to get a neuro exam on? Are we obligated to, um, ask for things such as
transcranial Doppler or EEG or, or, or something to prove that there's
no injury from that or, you know, what are your thoughts on a situation
like that?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Great
question, and I think I'm. I'll probably use this phrase multiple times
in this discussion. Is it? It depends, um, partly it depends on what
modalities, one has available to them in their institution, but I think
the answer to that, if I could, um, if I come down from on it, is, no,
you're not obligated.

I think it's a luxury. , that some places may have that if you have
access to EEG or transcranial Doppler, it might be able to be used or
sort of a luxury in your diagnosis, but I don't think that's really
necessary. I would mostly treat them, as I said, with medical management
and then imaging, serial {[}00:14:00{]} imaging, both.

Of their neck and, of their brain. Um, and I think in a way, and then
you mentioned it earlier, Kevin, I thought that was really important. ,
supportive measures, like preventing, secondary injury, you know, which
means optimize the profusion pressure to the brain. , try to avoid or
lessen the likelihood of secondary insults such as hypotension, shock
and, and such.

So I don't think you're obligated to get those things. I think that
things like EEG, transcranial Doppler are more in the category of a
luxury if you have them. Um, but otherwise I would manage with a serial
imaging.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} So Dr.~Rasmussen in a patient
who remains neurologically intact and you plan to, um, that medically
manage and do serial imaging, what's the best timing for repeat imaging?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah, that's
a great question. And I, I think, um, for, um, for patients that we
manage and in my experience, we manage, we at least image him twice in
the hospital. While they're an {[}00:15:00{]} inpatient. So, , to make sure
that they're not changing or evolving, you know, in the acute phase of
their injury. So, um, you know, if, , if, .

The typical patient is someone with a, you know, with a blunt, um, head
injury and they have a finding at the time of, , of a grade one or grade
two carotid injury. Um, we get the CT at the time. They're admitted to
diagnose it. We follow them, you know, over the course of three or four
or five days as they recover from their injury.

They need another imaging study, I think within, you know, within the
first week to make sure that that. Grade one or grade two injury has not
evolved into an either a pseudo aneurysm, because remember, there's a,
by definition, a disruption of the arterial wall or an extension, you
know, from a grade one or grade two into something that's more, more
significant.

So I think the initial scan on admission, of course, and then within the
first seven days to make sure they've not, that injuries not evolving.
Um, {[}00:16:00{]} and then typically after that, I think, again, it depends
on. Um, sort of the severity and how the patient's doing, but probably
at a month after discharge from the hospital and then most of them will
heal.

, certainly grade ones will heal, hopefully grade two, but, but they do
need followed, , to the point of resolution or healing as an outpatient.
, usually with CT scans or CTA.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} Okay, great. And series of
these patients have shown that 60\% of them will have their injuries
devolve or change in greater severity in this period. Is the pattern
that you see typically that they tend to improve over time?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Well, I think
the, um, I think the grade, you know, the grade ones, , I think they do.
Um, they're, those are the ones where that's a minor or limited intimal
disruption. A small intimal flap that. that is not flow limiting. It's
not associated with thrombus or platelet aggregation or thrombus.

So I think most of the grade ones do, and I {[}00:17:00{]} think, I'm sure
the grade twos, I think it certainly a greater percentage of those are
prone to evolve into, you know, a longer deception formation of thrombus
around them or into a pseudo aneurysm. And so that's the, the point of,
of serial imaging. You know, within the first week of the injury.

, and then certainly, you know, , another one within the first month of
the injury he had at best case, certainly if they begin to evolve or you
see on that second CT. That the image that the injury's changing, let's
say it's a grade two to your point that you think and you see signs that
it's evolving, then by all means then that that needs then more
intensive imaging and likely if it's evolving into something more
significant, it needs an intervention.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} Okay, so a pseudo aneurysm is
what we consider grade three. what is your approach to managing a pseudo
aneurysm of the carotid?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah, so I
think the, the suitor aneurysms {[}00:18:00{]} of the carotid, um, you know,
that in a way it depends. It's influenced certainly on, um, the
patient's neuro status or the location of the pseudo aneurism. And then
I think the expertise of, of the team that's managing the patient. Um,
but I think that the pseudo aneurysms, um, all of them, no matter what
size they, they need to be treated, they, they require, um, you know,
um, they require an intervention to fix them.

Um, there certainly are some patients who, um. Who's you know, have a
high mortality. They, they're, they're, they're quite ill or have a
high, high injury severity score. They may not make it. There's some
patients that one may pass and not fix a pseudo aneurysm or grade three
entry, but by and large, most do because the pseudo aneurysms will.

, will, um, they will not go away. Then they're likely to get bigger and
become associated with either expansion and mass effect or bleeding or
thrombus formation, stroke. Um, so, um, the, the ways to treat them, I
think are {[}00:19:00{]} these days primarily with endovascular techniques
that include covering, , the pseudo aneurysm with a small coverage
stent.

Or what we'd call a stent graft, a small covered stent to seal the, the
opening of the pseudo aneurysm. You know, there are some reports and
experiences using what we call a bare metal stent, um, through which
coils can be placed to thrombose the pseudo aneurysm to cause it to
clot. And then the bare metal stent then, you know, maintains the
integrity of the wall.

Um. Such that, flow is maintained through the, through the lumen, those
both use of a stent graft or recovered stent or coiling of the pseudo
aneurysm, or interventional techniques or endovascular techniques that
are performed most commonly through a transfemoral approach, an RJ order
gram, and then selection of the.

of the {[}00:20:00{]} effected carotid artery and then placement of the, of
the endovascular treatment. Um, I think those, these days are probably
the most common. Certainly if, it is, um, in, you know, in zone two of
the neck, and we can talk about that a little bit. , and it's amenable
to an operation. Um, there's another indication for an operation in that
area than, than certainly open repair of the pseudo aneurysm can also
be.

Undertaken, but I think more commonly these days for grade two injuries,
they're managed with an endovascular technique.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} In your book,
it's mentioned that, um, considering waiting seven days to decrease
neuro events, , what's the thought behind this?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah,
definitely. I think that, if a patient, um. You know, Harrigan, it
depends. I think that it depends on the patient. There are some patients
who just are in no shape to undergo. Um, you know, , , an intervention
such as this in the acute, , in the acute setting, the first two or
three days and, and certainly in those patients waiting is, is just, you
don't have a choice.

You need to wait. I think Yeah. If the patients, um, {[}00:21:00{]} you
know, are awake, let's say they're awake and otherwise normal, um, you
know, in those patients, if they're, if it's a pseudo aneurysm, the
patient's awake and, , able to be examined. I, I often don't wait seven
days. I think the waiting period probably more pertains to patients with
polytrauma, maybe an associated TBI and, and a, and a more complex, ,
complex course.

I think if it's more. A cut and dry, the patient's awake, , able to be
examined. They're out of the unit. , then I don't wait necessarily seven
days.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Got it. So, , for
the grade four injuries, , the occlusions, we just do medical management
for these patients if they're already included. can you just talk to us
briefly about, how you decide on medical management, whether you were
using anti-platelets or dual anti-platelets or anticoagulation?

How do you go about this?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah. So this
is really, um, an area where it is, um, you know, we don't have a lot of
good, we don't have really any good data. We have. {[}00:22:00{]} Really
good clinical experiences by a lot of expert groups, but we don't have a
lot of, um, prospective data or level one data that guides our
management in these cases.

Um, and so I think, um, patients with occluded, let's say a blunt
carotid and secluded grade for injury, um, patients who do not have
associated injuries or conditions. That preclude the use of
anticoagulation, then I will use the anticoagulation. We'll, we'll give
them, , intravenous heparin, um, and, um, monitor them with repeat
imaging and obviously, um, monitor them to make sure they're not over
anticoagulated in pain.

And that tends to be the exception because many of these patients have
polytrauma, so they have an associated TBI. Or other body regions that
have been severely injured. So that anticoagulation is not an option.
And in those cases, , we are really left with using, um. , {[}00:23:00{]} an
antiplatelet like, um, clopidogrel or aspirin.

In those cases, I'll often use both, , dual antiplatelet therapy,
clopidogrel and aspirin. And these are in patients who cannot receive
full anticoagulation because of other injuries. Um, one point there, I
think if, if one's going to use anticoagulation, and I think this group,
Um, you know, Kevin, you and Nicole are, and those of us who get called
frequently for bleeding complications are sensitive to this.

But in these, these patients, we're going to use anticoagulation on for
a blunt grade four blond carotid injury. I really try to avoid, ,
protocol based, bolusing. Of anticoagulation. I think our internal
medicine friends and often our intensivist get into these protocols
where they'll use large boluses of heparin as if the patient's being
treated for a PE.

And I think that, I try to avoid that because I, in my experience, that
leads to {[}00:24:00{]} bleeding complications either in the brain. The neck
or somewhere else in these injured patients. So I typically will, when I
start anticoagulation on these patients start pretty slow with a goal
PTT of 50 to 70 and in the first 24 hours, I often will say 50 is better
than 70 because these patients with this type of trauma are just prone
to bleed.

Um, and then work up slowly to therapeutic anticoagulation without
boluses. Um, and again, these are patients that they use the
anticoagulation and the don't have on the, they shouldn't have other
major injuries. So then they get transitioned to an oral anticoagulant
for, 30 to 90 days.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} That's a really
good point.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} Okay, great. So why don't we
move on to discuss blend for tibial artery. Injuries, um, Dr.~Rasmussen,
when you're assessing a patient's imaging who is presenting with a
trauma and a blunt vertebral artery injury, what are the kinds of things
that you look for in terms of the dominance of the vertebral,{[}00:25:00{]}
um, and how that affects your management?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah, good
point. And you've used. Kindly, , , tips, um, pointing me in the right
direction. I think it, depends upon, you know, one of the main things
is, , well, first of all, starting with a physical exam, and as we've
mentioned, you know, how, how is the patient, when you first assess
them, do they have.

No signs of bleeding in the neck, airway compromise, et cetera. But
then, you know, quickly with these patients, and to your point, you get
to the imaging and, and I think one of the key things is it, which
vertebral, is it the dominant vertebral artery that is affected? Or is
it the diminutive, um, for TBL? Or, or maybe you can't tell.

Um, but I think that is important. Um, and then I think, It's similar in
some ways to the carotid injuries. It's the severity of that vertebral
injury, both its location, um, anatomically which of the vertebral
segments. And then, you know, what is the, what is the severity of the
injury?

Is that a mild. grade one intimal flap {[}00:26:00{]} that's sort of seems
non flow limiting, or is it a full full blown occlusion, , , of the
vertebral? And then lastly, is it associated with a baseline artery
defactor posterior circulation, stroke? Those are sort of the things
that I try to go through in my mind.

Um. As I look at the imaging, you know, one thing that's important to
mention, and we were just talking about this with one of our residents
or trainees, , last week we did a first rib resection and talked about,
um, the severity of, of impact that it takes to make these create these
sorts of sorts of injuries.

You know, I think. What I would say is yes, be focused on the vertebral
artery, or in the case of the carotid, be focused on the carotid, but
also be aware that in, oftentimes these cases can be associated with
other torso, vascular injuries, blunt aortic injuries and such. So, you
know, like, like we always try to do ourselves or teach.

You know, don't get tunnel {[}00:27:00{]} vision with these patients. Look
at their imaging with regards to the vertebral, but also be aware that,
, they often have other injuries that you need to open the aperture to
see.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} That's great.
from my experience, , most of these injuries of the routine rules are
managed non-operatively or occasionally with embolization, maybe, um, by
neuro, I R. unless there's maybe a pseudo aneurysm, and per your book,
90\% of these stenotic lesions will resolve. Um. Is that the experience
that you have to,

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yes. And I
think the, you know, this, they fall into a similar management pattern,
is the blunt carotid injuries. Um, maybe not quite the same because
their natural history is a little different, but, but I think the, you
know, as far as serial imaging, um, management with, , either expectant
medical management for burn for those that are, that are less severe,
and then endovascular management.

Um, with those that are more severe, I think, you know, in a way, they
do fall into a {[}00:28:00{]} similar management pattern. And yes, , the
majority of those that, , that are low grade do resolve for or become
asymptomatic over the long period. Meaning they may, the receivable may,
may, if it's thrombosis, I mean, oftentimes that does not result in.

Stroke. It just, depends, you know, but many of the smaller injuries
certainly do resolve over time. , and, and that can be seen with the
serial imaging approach that we've already talked about.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} So Dr.~Rasmussen, um, Kevin
mentioned that a lot of these vertebral injuries, especially if they're
kind of high up. In the neck or the skull base are managed by neuro IRR
or conservatively, but if you need to expose the proximal vertebral
artery in the neck, what's your approach for that surgically.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Right? So
that's a, that is exposed through a supraclavicular incision. Um, and
for those who have, um. Looked at up or {[}00:29:00{]} performed, um, a
carotid subclavian bypass, for example, or the, the exposure of the
subclavian artery. Most mostly that exposure, or most commonly that
supraclavicular incision is, is described for exposure of the, the, of
the subclavian artery.

Um, but through that same supraclavicular exposure, um. No, the
vertebral artery can be found a little bit more proximal on the
subclavian artery. So that's, that's sort of the, that's the, that's the
incision or approach. Um, and you know, it depends upon the, you know,
one, um, you know, what one is operating for, if it's, if it's for, for
bleeding and the intent is to, to control bleeding or ligated, that's
actually most commonly.

The case, I mean, is, is that, , you know, that exposure is then used
because it's a hematoma and, and there's, , there's bleeding. Um, you
know, then the intent is to expose, , um, the, the vertebral is, it
comes off of the, the subclavian and to {[}00:30:00{]} litigate it, it's
rare that one would be repairing or trying to restore flow in the
setting of trauma.

Um, to the vertebral artery, you know, through that incision. We don't
really typically do for Teebo reconstructions for trauma. typically if
you're doing it through an open operation, it's really to control
bleeding and, and, , probably gonna end up lying eight in it, just
because a re implanting the vertebral, you know, on the common carotid
or doing some sort of achievable reconstruction is just not well suited
for for the trauma situation, if that makes sense.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Yeah. And one
quick thing before we move on, I just wanted to touch you on a paragraph
that I took from your book. Um, that I think is really important because
we don't do. Artery exposure as much. I've only really done one in
fellowship. I've been a lot of credit subclavians where I see it, but an
actual exposure for TB and your book, it mentions you go in between the
two heads of the SCM.

Um, you open up the credit chief and you retract the carotid
immediately, and this will you, then you'll be able to identify this is
a critical {[}00:31:00{]} structure of the vertebral vein, which directly
posterior, which is directly posterior to the carotid. And this
vertebral vein is sort of a landmark that helps you identify the
vertebral artery and the proximal subclavian artery.

And the one of these that I've done that was exactly the, um, anatomic,
exposure

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah. Good
point. We didn't tie, I didn't talk about the anatomy or the specific
anatomical aspects. That's exactly right. I mean, I think one of the
things, a couple of things that are useful in addition to to the
vertebral vein, I think that, um. I think that identifying, the sternal
head and the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid, you know, and
trying to find it really in a lot of ways, you can go between those two
heads of the sternocleidomastoid.

Um, and it's in that sort of, that groove there where one can, um, and,
and oftentimes that's just a, I mean, it is, there's an open plane there
between the, and if you can look at your anatomy book, kind of get that
out and see the. The sternal head and the clinic killer had, , really
the window there, um, lead you then, you know, to that area where
posteriorly, there {[}00:32:00{]} will be the, the vertebral artery will
come off.

And so claiming, um, you know, you can feel the carotid, um, and it's
just beyond, um, it's just beyond the takeoff, at least on the right is
just beyond the takeoff of the carotid artery.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Great. And now
that we're kind of talking about operations and we're going to keep
diving into penetrating injuries of the neck. So dr , we just want to
just kind of start with some of the basics, , when we're talking about
the zones of the neck, , and, and what are the anatomic considerations
of each of these zones.

Um, can you just tell us what zone one is and kind of what you're
thinking of if you hear of a vascular injury in this area?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah, so, you
know, so zone one, so the zones of the neck, you know, really, um, refer
to the, um, the anterior, um, aspects of the neck. Um, and so the, the
sort of the anterior triangles of the neck, and, um. The zone one really
is, is the most proximal. It's the inferior, , aspects of the, um, , of
that, of that.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} So doctor asked
me, he said, I think we're going to dive now into penetrating carotid
trauma and start with sort of the basics, , diving into the zones of the
neck and some of the things you take into consideration with each of
these zones in the neck as far as getting control.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} So um, the
zones of the neck, um, that are, have been used to help us
conceptualize, um, you know, penetrating injury mostly. . Oh, really?
Apply to the anterior portion of the neck. , kind of the anterior
triangle of the neck. Um, zone one is, is the, is the, , is the sort of
the first and the most, I guess.

Um, proximal zone, and it's really defined, um, by the sternal notch to
the cricoid cartilage. So it's a tight or narrow zone that really
involves the thoracic outlet. Um, zone two is the cricoid cartilage to
the angle of the mandible, which is, um, sort of the largest of the, of
the three zones, , in the {[}00:33:00{]} neck, the intern neck.

And then zone three is from the angle of the mandible to the base of the
skull. Like, zone one's on three's pretty tight. Um, there's not a lot
of space there. Um, and those zones, um, I think are useful and that
have been described. , there was original paper led by, um, dr rune, R
O, N, H, J rune, and, , , in the journal of trauma in 1979 that, first
described those, those zones, um, it was called evaluation and treatment
of penetrating cervical, , injuries and in those zones I think are
really useful just as a, to help us conceptualize into, to try to, ,
manage, different forms of penetrating injury or different areas of
penetrating injury.

Um, so those are the zones. , I think that. You know, teaching, , at
least over the years has been the, penetrating injuries to zone one and
zone three largely, um, require, you know, imaging at the outset. Um,
and maybe either non-operative repair or at least imaging first with, ,
because they're very difficult areas to expose penetrating injuries to
{[}00:34:00{]} zone two.

Um, traditionally have been in the teaching has been that those are all
managed with, , an open operation and exploration of the neck.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Um, and then for
zone three, sort of, I think, much like zone one, , we depend on sort of
imaging and angiography, , for treatment of these injuries. kind of want
to dive straight into this and, , discuss how do we manage credit
injuries. So we're, we're going to just pitch some scenarios at you and
we, can discuss some of the nuances of it.

Um. If you have a penetrating carotid injury, um, zone two, , and the
patient is neuro intact. Um, I mean, it's this kind of the most
straightforward situation. But, , I guess, I guess a better question to
you is, is , if they're neurologically intact, how do we determine
whether or not you're going to repair the credit injury

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah. I well,
I think probably the case-based scenarios are probably best because. You
know, each management, um, as I mentioned, the zones are there to
provide some conceptualization, help us to categorize our management.
But, , the, management of any given cases is often, individualized.

So in this particular case, yes, I mean, whether or {[}00:35:00{]} not
they're, um, neurologically intact certainly matters. Um, I think with
penetrating zone to injury, um. I would still operate on that. I think
that, that, that, um, I think that paradigm is changing with modern
imaging technologies, CTA mostly, um, and clinical experience.

But I think that teaching is in the case that you've presented a
penetrating zone to neck injury with a carotid or penetrating zone to
wound with a carotid injury, then that patient would be. Operated on
with an open operation.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} the neurodeficit
portion of it, um, you know, historically there was concerns over if you
repair this carotid injury, um, you know, that you could create
intercranial hemorrhage. So, say you have a patient that comes in with a
zone, two injury with, , you know, on the right neck with. Left-sided
neuro symptoms. Um, w what are your thoughts on that? Does, does the
neuro status play into it or do you repair, the carotid.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah, I think
that, and these days, you know, as I mentioned or alluded to, we have
the benefit of CT imaging. So, you know, the, the {[}00:36:00{]} paradigm of
that was. I mentioned the, AGA rune paper from 1979 and that really set
up the, the zones, you know, that was in really, um, that was in an era
where we did not have, and for many decades after that, we didn't really
have the benefit of routine high quality contrast CT imaging.

Today we're operating in that, , in this new era with. Routine, high
contrast or high quality contrast CT scan. So, um, I think in your case,
you know it, if the injury has a CT scan, um, which is likely to have
these days unless the, unless the injury was associated with bleeding
and the patient was just taken immediately to the, or, you're going to
have a CT image.

If the CT image shows. You know, a grade one type of injury, you almost
extrapolating the, you know, the, the blunt characterization or the
blunt categories. If it's zone one, then I suppose, you know, those may
also, you know, may not choose to operate on those, but I think
penetrating wounds, I would, {[}00:37:00{]} I would operate on them and I
think, um.

No.~Cause I think they're going to evolve. And they, the other thing
about exploring zone to the neck is that you can explore for other
Aerojet aerodigestive injuries. I mean that, that's the other dictum or
part of this is to make sure that there's not an injury to the, to the,
, to the airway or to the esophagus, as, as, as you perform the zone to
neck exploration.

So, um. You know, I think that they get, , an exploration. They get a,
you see the carotid, , and , , you explore and you see the injury and
then you manage it depending upon what the injury looks like at the time
of open exploration. I mean, it's hard. I think it would be hard for me
to sit on a penetrating zone to wound that has a.

Carotid injury, I, it's potentially described. Um, , and I think, um,
but I think, um, there's a couple of reasons that I would err on the
side of, of operating on that.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Yeah. And I
think, , historically, they talked about, like I mentioned, the
intercranial hemorrhage. So if you had, say, a, , a very, , beat
{[}00:38:00{]} up looking carotid artery, um, or maybe. near thrombosis that
they would leave it, um, because they're afraid of reproducing the
brain, causing intracranial hemorrhage.

But it seems like the consensus now, at least from your book and the
East guidelines is, to repair these deficits, , or to repair these
credit injuries because the mortality and final nerdy neuro status, ,
has been shown to be better in these patients. even if they started with
a neurodeficit.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} And I think
that we, you know, as vascular surgeons who do carotid endarterectomy, ,
routinely, I think we're more so, I don't, I do not. So, first of all,
this is a complex, . Complex scenario. So I, I'm definitely won't throw
shade on any previous experiences with this sort of heroin, um, injury
pattern.

I do think that we, um. You know, for those of us who manage and perform
carotid endarterectomy routinely, we sort of are, are familiar, I guess,
when maybe not good with it, but we're at least familiar with trying to
mitigate hyperperfusion syndrome or reprofusion syndrome. And I think
that is, um, you know, that's just part of the, the management.

There's the technical management of the injury, and then there's the
communication with anesthesia to try to lower the blood pressure and the
overall profusion pressure. Um, in these patients after you repair the
carotid, um, it's not unlike communicating with anesthesia about
resuscitation, right?

We need to, communicate with anesthesia in this case, to mitigate
hyperperfusion or reprofusion and worsening of a brain injury. We, we,
need to, , {[}00:39:00{]} communicate with anesthesia as well as do a good
job of fixing the, the injury.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} That is a great point. Um, what
about in a situation where you have a patient who has a large infarct.
On the same side as a carotid injury. What is your approach in that
situation?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah. So I
think, um, you know, and it depends upon the injury. you know, I think
if this is a penetrating zone to wound. Um, you know, in nearly all
instances, you know, so you're going to explore it. Um, because it's his
own two neck injury. Um, I mean, I, I think, um. You know? Okay. So
there may be some that are, that are sort of there.

I'm trying to avoid the words. It depends. Um, you know, I suppose there
are some minor penetrating injuries where the, the image, , you know,
it's a small stab wound or ice pick type of thing. , in, in, in,
there's, there's, there's no hematoma. It's looks like there's a injury
to the carotid. That's, , that's, that's, .

, resulted in, , in an infarct or a stroke, but there's no bleeding or
pseudo aneurysm. Um, there might be scenarios where you would observe
it. I, I don't, that's not a practice that I, a spouse. I would explore
all of these. I still sort of fall, fall back on exploring all
penetrating zone two injuries. Um, and in that case then you're going to
be in the neck anyway.

You're going to see the injury to the carotid. And I guess your
question. Nicole is in the setting of an infarct, would you then repair
the carotid? Um, I mean, your options are either to repair it, do
nothing to it or, or lie gated and I guess as a vascular surgeon, um,
you know, I would repair it. Um, I think observing {[}00:40:00{]} it while
you're there looking at it is then you risk it evolving into a pseudo
aneurysm and you having to re operate on it, you know, days or weeks
later.

As it is, the small injuries of all. Um, and I think, you know, the, the
question of, well, if he's already at the patient already has an
infarct, would you like it? Um, I think that that don't, that's just not
something that is a vascular surgeon, um, that, that I would pursue. I
think, um, um, I would try to, , I would try to repair the injury
reperfused the hemisphere.

Um, acknowledged that, yes, you could make things worse with
reprofusion. but, , you also may take up a number that was ischemic and
you may reproduce it and, and push the penumbra in a positive direction.
So, you know, there's not a lot of data in this area. And I mentioned
the word heroin. Um, you know, these are the most challenging of, of
injury scenarios for sure.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Definitely. Yeah.
there's no easy answers there,

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} I mean, what
do you think, Nicole? What do you guys think and what's your experience?
I mean, I, {[}00:41:00{]} I'm, I'm interested also in what you guys think
about that case.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} I have one
experience with this. It was in residency. Um, we had a, a person that
was sleeping and, , a, a pressure washer guy came up to him and asked
him to move. He refused to move and they got in a fight and I got the
pressure washer straight to the neck. , tore open his carotid. They came
into the ER holding pressure on his neck and huge hemiparesis on the
contralateral side.

Um, in that case, we did repair the carotid, and he did have a dense
hemiparesis after the case. Um, you know, whether litigating would have
helped or not, you know, we don't know, but that, that's my, that's my
one experience.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} Um, I actually haven't seen a
situation like this,

but it's definitely a tough, it's a tough situation. I think if you have
an injury that's going to cause potential for bleeding or a pseudo
aneurysm. And the vessel is payment, then my {[}00:42:00{]} inclination
would be to repair it. Um, if you're doing, if you have like an
occlusion of the artery, when you explore it, you know, say you try to
do a thrombectomy and you're not getting any retrograde bleeding.

That might be a situation where I've considered ligating it, but these
are tough calls.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} I think
you're, I think you're spot on. And I think as surgeons, you know, at
you know, at some point, um, , you know, um, um, I won't speak for other
of my colleagues. , and I'm not saying that we. Try to teach this mantra
to our trainees. But you know, sometimes what comes to mind is, well,
don't overthink it. you're a vascular surgeon.

You've explored a vascular injury. There's a hole in the artery or
disrupted artery, do what we do, which is fix it. And, um, again, I
don't mean to be, um, , overly simplistic. I'm not trying to be, um, ,
sarcastic, but I, I think we get to that point. Where you know you're
going to have to fix it.

It would be very difficult to just not do anything. And I think, um, in
the case that you described Kevin, um, I think that's important. You do
need to know going into these, that the outcome's going to be likely to
be stroke. You know, whether you make the stroke better or worse, um,
you're not {[}00:43:00{]} really going to know by fixing the artery.

Um. And so the outcome's going to be pretty bad. , either way, I think
that's important for family and the patients and, for the care team to
recognize. Um, these situations, but, um, to me fixing it as, unless
Nicole, you bring up a good point. If the carotids occluded, then yeah,
I think then that is a time when I would like eat it.

And I think this is where we fall back on our experience with carotid
endarterectomy and managing, you know, a string sign that we thought was
there from a carotid occlusive disease. And you explore the string sign.
And by the way, the carotid was occluded. In those cases, in a setting
of a carotid endarterectomy, we actually likely ligated.

, and so I think we fall back on some of the similar principles that we
pursue and we're fixing age related carotid disease.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Definitely, , and
for completeness sake, there's another large. That's hole in the neck, ,
that we encounter injuries to, , what is your thought on, , internal
jugular injuries? , can you like eight one, two, or

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah, I
think, , I mean, you certainly can. {[}00:44:00{]} One can certainly, um, ,
like eight, these I think, um, um, and not have. Um, consequential
effects in most patients. Um, internal carotid arteries that are, I'm
sorry, the internal jugular veins that I have repaired have been in the
situation of a significant TBI.

So a patient has, you know, um, , bleeding in the neck. You explore,
explore the. the neck and the patient also has a penetrating wound to
the head and intracranial hypertension and, you know, needed a
decompressive craniectomy or something. in those cases, I have repaired
the internal jugular vein to maintain venous outflow of that side of the
brain.

Um, you know, I'm never sure whether or not that is necessary, but, um,
you know, I think it, it makes sense to me. I think, . In one case, I
remember before I repaired the internal jugular vein, you know, we
transduced a venous pressure, , towards the cranial side, and the venous
pressure was, you know, 40 or 50 millimeters of mercury, and there was a
gradient, right?

Eight millimeters of {[}00:45:00{]} mercury on the, on the cardiac side, or
the proximal or central side. So to me, if there's a gradient, um, and
the patient's got a TBI. Um, you know, I think fixing it is at least
reasonable. but most of the time you can lie gate, the external jugular,
, the internal juggler.

Um, and there's enough collateral, venous drainage that, , the patients
will do fine.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} Okay. So going back to repair
of the carotid artery and these, , trauma situations. So, you know, we
fall back on the standard steps that we use in, um, you know, other
types of vascular surgery. , the first thing being getting proximal and
distal control. And then Dr.~Rasmussen, can you speak to us about
heparin ization and how you manage that in the trauma setting?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah. I think
this is, I'm in this injury pattern more than, um, more than most or
more than any other arterial injury pattern. You, you've, you have to
use heparin in these cases. So, um, you know, it's a, , in some injury
patterns, you kind of have to be ready for a wild ride. Because because
you explore the neck for bleeding {[}00:46:00{]} in a, and if the patient
has poly trauma, there's bleeding elsewhere.

Um, and now you're going to fix the carotid artery, , in some manner.
You're going to either put in a shunt or, or just repair it primarily,
or you're going to have to, if you're going to clamp the carotid artery,
, in my experience, you're going to need to use heparin. And so what I
mean by a wild dried is, you know, you're.

Explore the patient for bleeding, they're already bleeding. And now what
do you do? You give more heparin. Um, the key there is to try to fix the
carotid is, you know, as quickly as you can, , try to manage the, the
other areas of bleeding while the patients have denies. Um, and then,
you know, bring them off of pepper and after the carotid is repaired.

I think unlike, for example, I think there's extremity arterial injuries
that can sometimes be managed without heparin. But I think if you're
going to go to the trouble of, , in the, in the, in the technical, um,
challenge of, fixing a traumatic carotid injury, um, I think in nearly
{[}00:47:00{]} every case you got to give systemic, , heparin.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} so you know, you
have proximal and distal control. Now the patients have pronounced, um,
and how, how do you decide, um, whether to use a shunt or not and what
type of shot do you use.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah. So, um,
you know, so the tenants are not, and so once you've done that, the
tenants are similar to other Cherrelle injuries. Um, you need to, um,
identify the injury and then. Remove the burden of thrombus. Often that
can be done with flushing, you know, back bleeding of the internal
carotid or back blading and for bleeding.

And then, passage of a thrombectomy catheter, obviously passing a
thrombectomy catheter up. The internal carotid needs to be done. Um, you
know, very carefully. It's usually a two or three Fogarty catheter and
just a centimeter two. You really don't want to be putting a Fogarty
catheter. Distill into the internal carotid more than a centimeter too.

Hopefully you can rely on back bleeding, you know, and back bleeding
from that internal can quote unquote blow out any thrombus that's there.
Um, same with the proximal, but do {[}00:48:00{]} be aware that you need to
get rid of the thrombus burden in those arteries before you fix them.
Um, whether or not to use a shunt, I mean, I think in most cases of
trauma, um.

I, I have to say that I do not use a shunt, um, because it's, it's too,
um, it adds just another level of complexity to a case that's already
complex. Um, and if I were to use a Shaunte, I would use either an
Argyle, Sean's or a short son. Shant, S U N D T. , or the Argyle.
Shawn's. I think it's reasonable to do that.

Um, let's say you've got a long segment, um, the loss of the carotid
artery, you're going to need to do an interposition graft, let's say.
Um, and, and in that case, you, you know, you're going to have to go
harvest vein. Um, um, you know, in those cases, I suppose, sure. It's,
it's reasonable in those cases to put in a shunt to reproduce that
hemisphere of the brain.

, while the conduit is, is harvested or prepared. Um, so certainly there
are times when I have used a shunt in the setting of trauma, but, um, I
always also, I also try to keep in mind {[}00:49:00{]} too, in the case of
carotid trauma, to try to keep it as simple as possible. Keep in mind,
um, That the internal carotid can also be transposed over onto the
external carotid artery as a transposition.

You know, in some cases, depending upon the precise location of the
injury, so that, you know, you don't need an interposition graft. And in
those cases, you know, you would not use a either. Um. So, you know, I
think, yeah, be, be mindful to use the shot and be ready, sort of think
about it, but also, um, if you find that fixing, it sets up pretty
quickly, either with an interposition graft or with a carotid
transmission transposing the internal onto the external.

If that sets up pretty quickly, , I do not think you should feel
obligated to use a shunt in the setting of trauma.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} Okay. Great. Um, so. Options
for repair dictated somewhat by the injury and the size of the injury.
Um, you mentioned harvesting vein. Um, I think that's a good point,
especially in cases where you're {[}00:50:00{]} exploring the neck and
there's also an aerodigestive injury, um, in order to avoid putting
prosthetic in the vein option is nice.

Um, what if you have a small injury and you're just planning to do a
patch?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} So, For the
patch, I would either use, , personally, I would use Dacron or, , um, ,
bovine pericardium. You know, I think something, some prosthetic that's
available, , you know, hemophilia Dacron patch, , or bovine pericardium,
um, as a patch. And I think, you know, you raise a really good point
there that I think if it's, clearly a contaminated wound.

A penetrating wound where, you know, whether it's because there's an
injury to the esophagus or the airway, or it's a shotgun wound, and so
there's a large soft tissue injury or a fragment wound that's really
contaminated. Then I think in those cases, yes, I think efforts to
harvest vein sappiness Maine probably, are advised, um.

I will say that if it's the opposite of that, if it's sort of a simple
penetrating wound, there's no evidence, at least overt evidence of
aerodigestive injury. There's no really other contamination. Let's say
it's a stab wound. , , you know, and it's not a big {[}00:51:00{]} soft
tissue all quickly, , also use, , , Dacron or PTFE and, or position
graft and not use the, um, as I mentioned before, I think, um.

You know, you try to be mindful of keeping these operations, um, you
know, as, as, , expeditious as possible. You try to move them along.
And, um, in the case where there's not a lot of contamination, um, or
any contamination, um, I also will then not use me. You know, I think, ,
, using a Dacron interposition graft or PTFE in this larger vessel,
these common carotid is, .

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} Okay, great. Then I think one
important point also to mention is that you need to debris back any
devitalized tissue. Um, so you know, if there's a defect in the artery,
but the tissue around it is pretty ratty. You know, you may have to
actually debried it back and make the defect larger initially before you
repair it.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Really good
point. Yeah. This ma'am. And the same with us, Sean. That's why. You
know, I said, be ready to use a shot. {[}00:52:00{]} Certainly in some
situations you need to use a shun, but you know, using the shot, you can
also, , either create a concrete, you know, an injury or cause you to
need to debris the artery back a little further.

Um, so really good point.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} , start, you're
asking some, one point that I picked up from reading your chapter here
is that, , we're talking about back bleeding from the internal carotid
and it made the point of back bleeding is restored. , you should perform
an interrupt angiogram. To document complete evacuation of distal
thrombus.

Um, can you just speak to this.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Yeah. I
think, a completion study, um. Um, is is definitely, , something to,
consider or to perform. Now, I think we've used the, we've, we've used
the phrase during our discussion here this afternoon, , a luxury. You
know, there's some of these things that you have the luxury to do. You
know, in some cases of trauma, you, may not have the luxury to perform.

an on the table. Arteriogram so, um, in those cases, I would use duplex,
, if you have duplex or even, use , the, {[}00:53:00{]} duplex function of,
the ultrasound that you have in the, or to show flow. Um, you know, and
then the, the most simple thing is a continuous wave Doppler.

And so some form of assessment of your repair certainly is indicated.
Um, the complexity of that completion exam depends on what. Capabilities
you have and how the patient's doing. Um, so certainly in an ideal
situation, you're fully outfitted. You've got, , experienced colleague
or partner or fellow with you, and, um, you know, the patient is on the
right imaging table and you can do a completion arteriogram then
absolutely.

I would, , put a, 18 gauge butterfly in the common carotid artery. Make
sure it's. The aired so that you don't inject air and shoot a completion
arteriogram, , both the repair and the distal internal carotid to assure
that there's no thrombus in situations where you're not that outfitted
and you don't have that luxury then using a duplex ultrasound.

Um, I think is, {[}00:54:00{]} is fine. And in those cases, you don't have
duplex or the patients just, . , has enough injuries that are in his, in
a complicated enough situation using a continuous wave Doppler and, and,
and just, finishing up is also

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} I'm curious. Dr.~Rasmussen, do
you use a completion imaging study for elective carotid repairs?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} At this
point? Um, yeah, we use, , ultrasound. We use duplex ultrasound, but not
arteriography. I mean, I think that the arteriography point is, , is
useful. I appreciate that. And, , I think, for those who have done that
before and are used to doing it, it's reasonable. The, the counter to
that would be, well, let's say you see a little bit of thrombus. in the
distal internal, beyond your room repair, what are you going to do about
it? so it, it's not to make light of or diminish the need for,
confirming a technically adequate or perfect repair. but I think,
{[}00:55:00{]} to some of my previous comments, you know, we as surgeons, I
think, try to strike this balance between, I mean, um.

You know, being perfect and then spending too much time overthinking it
and, , , carotid angiography completion angiography in the setting of
trauma may just not be feasible in a lot of cases. Um, or people may not
have the experience in doing it.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} Right. Okay, so what if there's
a concomitant tracheal or esophageal injury? Do you do anything

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Well, I mean,
I think we, we didn't mention the word, we didn't mention drains. So,
you know, in all of these cases where we've explored his own to
penetrate a neck injury, those patients are all drained. , with, , you
know, for me, , , a seven millimeter flat JP drain or, or maybe more,
um, I guess that's a great question.

I don't know that there's a situation where I really buttressed , or
done used any adjuncts {[}00:56:00{]} to cover my repair. Um, the
vascularity of the neck. Um, um. is good and if not, great. And I think
that helps. I think if you've drained the, , the, , the, the wound that
is also sort of a mitigating step.

And I'm not sure that I have buttressed, , or done anything, um, more
than that to protect the arterial repair. And maybe it's because I've
not had any that have had. overt esophageal injury. They may be, you
know, micro injury or something like that. Small. do you think, Nicole?

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_host.individual:} I've heard of using a muscle
flap to separate the. Esophageal injury from the arterial injury, but
I'm not sure if that's always necessary. And I do like the idea of the
drain, because that would prevent any

collection from building up there that could compromise your

arterial repair.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} I think that
those are both. Good points. I think the drain is in my mind, the drains
of mosque. Even if you explore the zone too. Yeah. You still know,
{[}00:57:00{]} because remember many of this opera deal injury, you just not
going to see, and honestly. I don't know that any of us are familiar
enough with exposing the esophagus, , through that wound, we, we may
sort of see the esophagus, and do the best we can, but many of this off
the GL injuries will be pretty small, um, or we may not see them.

, so I think that, , the drain is a must, , in these injuries, at least
one and a muscle flap, I guess is something to consider if there's gross
contamination. You know, either spillage from a softened geo wound or
they're just gross contamination, the wound.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Well, Dr.
Rasmussen, once again, . We've covered a lot of topics in one session
and we really appreciate your expertise and insight

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Well, it's a
pleasure to, to have the discussion with you this afternoon, and, um,
and I hope that it's useful to, to you and to your listeners. I know
it's been useful for me to run through a lot of these scenarios with you
this afternoon, so {[}00:58:00{]} thanks for the opportunity.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} And I think we
still have at least one more topic to cover in the future. endovascular
slash were boa management of trauma, if you're up for it.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_todd.rasmussen\_uss.edu.individual:} Sure thing.
Happy to. Happy to visit with you guys anytime.

\textbf{ringr\_116213\_115337\_krkniery\_gmail.com.individual:} Great. thank you
again.

\section{Endovascular Approaches}\label{endovascular-approaches}}

\textbf{09 Feb 2021}: \emph{Kevin Kniery, MD, MPH; Marlin ``Wayne'' Causey MD; Todd
Rasmussen, MD}

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} {[}00:00:00{]} Welcome back to behind the knife and
audible bleedings vascular trauma podcast series with Dr.~Todd
Rasmussen. Today are in our final episode. We're going to discuss the
endovascular management of acute vascular injury specifically. We're
going to focus on. Thoracic , , blunt aortic injury and endovascular
treatment options for EXITO subclavian injuries.

Um, today we're lucky enough to have Dr.~Todd Rasmussen. He's a Colonel
United States air force and his professor of surgery and an associate
Dean of research at the uniform services. University of health sciences
is an attending vascular surgeon at Walter Reed national military
medical center. Welcome back Dr.

Rasmussen.

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Thanks very much. , Kevin for the opportunity I look
forward to. A good discussion on a, on a, I think a really important
topic. Thank you. Great.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} {[}00:01:00{]} And , , we also have Dr.~Wayne Kasi. He's
the chief of vascular surgery at San Antonio military medical center at
a level one trauma center in San Antonio, Texas.

And he's an associate professor of surgery at the uniformed services,
university of health sciences. So a welcome,

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} thanks, Kevin.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} All right , well, let's just dive in. We're going to
focus first on the blunt, thoracic aortic injury and the endovascular
management of that. So I think it's important to understand.

how this occurs and what patients is occurs in. So blunt, thoracic Edric
injury is rare, but it's very lethal. It's less than 1\% of all blunt
traumas, but it's the second leading cause of death in blunt trauma.

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} Yes, Kevin, that's why whenever I'm called about a
patient who has a blunt aortic injury.

I really want to know what their other injuries are because these are
usually very high velocity mechanism injuries, and there's a particular
concern that they'll have an intracranial injury.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Right. So, you know, when you're the trauma resident ,
, taking pages, you know, the things you want to think about, that'll
clue you into , , you know, we need to make sure they don't have this as
a high-speed motor {[}00:02:00{]} vehicle collisions, motorcycle crashes
vehicle versus pedestrians and falls from Heights are some of the most
common causes of blunt, thoracic aortic injury.

Yeah, I

think

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} it's most vascular surgeons have seen. It's pretty
amazing. Now the types of injuries people can survive. I mean, I've seen
people in cars who fallen over overpass, fallen off of overpasses people
being hit by trains, the prehospital management and the vehicle safety
features that exist now have really expanded what survivable.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah. And , um, yeah. Quickly, we're going to just
kind of review some of the anatomy of where these injuries occur is. Um,
so the aortic arch itself is relatively mobile. It doesn't have a lot of
tethering, but the descending thoracic aorta itself is actually kind of
tethered. And so , , it's it's at that junction just distal , , to the.

Subclavian artery , um, is where these injuries generally occur. Most of
them curved within about a half centimeter to two centimeters of the
left subclavian artery. And so it's at that junction that , , that the
aorta tears due to the deceleration. Um, so Wayne, do you have any
particular thoughts on the diagnostic methods for these?{[}00:03:00{]}

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} Well, I think most trauma centers have a pretty good
protocol, such as the level one trauma center we work at. Typically the
patients who come in with a really high velocity mechanism, injury, get
a CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. And oftentimes if
there's an extremity that's injured as well, that'll just be carried
down through the , , lower extremities as well, or the upper
extremities.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah. Great. So yeah, CTA , um, is critical in these
patients , um, to help , , diagnose this. And so it's important to
realize that , , patients with these injuries, the majority of them
greater than 75\% never make it to the hospital. Um, and those that do
make it, the hospital are likely going to be severely injured and in
multiple other ways.

And it's not gonna be an isolated injury. Um, so quickly, we're just
gonna go over the SVS grading system. There's a couple of ways to grade
these. The current one in the SVS is , , has four grades. The first one
is a grade one, intimal tear. Grade two is an intramural hematoma. Grade
three is a pseudo aneurysm.

So there's an actual contour of the aorta is {[}00:04:00{]} disrupted. And ,
, and then grade four is what they consider rupture. So those are the
four SVS grading systems and , um, When do you want to talk a little bit
about how Dr.~Starnes kind of breaks it down? Yes,

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} Kevin that's the official grading system. I remember
when behind the knife first started , , one of the first or second
episodes was an interview with Dr.

Ben Starnes. And I remember listening to his blunt, thoracic aortic
injury recommendations on the way to the hospital, as I would consult on
one of these blunt, thoracic aortic injuries. And he really categorize
these into three different categories based on his Harbor view data. ,
that was a minimal aortic injury , , which had a 10 millimeter or less
intimal tear, a moderate, which had a pseudo aneurysm.

And then the maximal, which I think he summed up very well and saying
that there was a unilateral, hemothorax active contrast. Extravasation a
periodic hematoma greater than two centimeters in maximum width. And
those were the patients that needed to go to the operating room,
basically at the time of the consult.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah. Yeah, that's a great point. So the, {[}00:05:00{]}
the Dr.~Star and slash Harbor view categorization is really just three
categories and they kind of depend on when you operate. So the minimal
ones you don't operate on. Those are just the intimal tears, the
moderate ones. They need an operation, but not emergently.

And the Maximo ones need a, an emergent operation. And so I think that
was part of his kind of reasoning for it. One of the things

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} that. Struck me with that podcast on behind the knife
was he mentioned that what's the point of having a grading system that.
Doesn't have a treatment with each different grade.

And so as Kevin goes through these, you'll see that there's a little bit
of overlap between the two grades. And the point of that previous
podcast was if you're going to have three treatments, then you need to,
which is imaging or surveillance , , delayed repair, and then urgent,
emergent, or urgent repair.

Then there needs to be three different grading scores,

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} right? Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think Dr.~Starnes in
that , , the grading system, you mentioned, I always find it to be sort
of {[}00:06:00{]} practical,, , it's very practical, , for, for us., the,
the four category classification is, is a little bit more technical and
maybe a little less practical, but , um, yeah, I agree.

I think it's , , That's true. You know, the other thing before we get
too far into this, I do think it's useful for your listeners., , Kevin T
there, there's a couple of classic, , um, you know, papers , , on. Blunt
aortic injury and , and, and they really speak to, for those who are
interested in vascular trauma, interested in this condition, I would ch
I would encourage you to dig into just two or three papers.

One of them is the original double AST paper led by Dr.~Dimitrios and
the team at LA County in the late 1990s. Um, on blunt aortic injury,
which not surprisingly in the late 1990s, that double AST, what we refer
to as the WST one study showed that nearly all a blenny already injuries
were fixed with an open thoracotomy and clamping and sewing into graft.

Um, the WST {[}00:07:00{]} repeated that study about 10 years later and in
2006 , , or so I think it was actually published in 2008 , um, where
they , , double it's called the double AST two study. So in the journal,
both of these were in the journal of trauma at the time. Now it's the
journal of trauma and acute care surgery.

Again, led by Dr.~Dimitrios says,, and, and in that 10 year period, the
management of blood aortic injury had completely. , evolved from open
repair to end a repair. And we won't go into the details of those
studies, but , um, you know, and then you go three or four years later,
and now there's the SBS that's writing these guidelines.

So which you've seen in those three papers, the WST one in 1998 or nine
was T2. In 2008, both in the journal of trauma. And now the leading
organization writing the guidelines is the SBS and not the WST. What you
see there is this evolution of, of the management of this, , this,
injury pattern from open, you know, to {[}00:08:00{]} nearly exclusively
endo now.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah, that is a fascinating evolution. Um, and very
interesting. I, I I've heard of those papers, but I didn't realize the
transition from the, the trauma journal to the vascular journal for the
kind of guidelines on it. Um,

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} surprisingly again , um, at the risk of you guys not
inviting me back, I don't mean to monopolize the conversation, but , um,
you know, the thing that's happened with that evolution is the
mortality, the survival of, of operating on these, these injuries has
improved.

Rates of paraplegia have decreased blood utilization is decreased. You
know , patients, patients have a better chance in 2020 than they did in
2000, you know, and it's largely because of the evolution to endo , ,
technologies that we've. We've mentioned, and I

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} bet there's not a whole lot of other specific things
in trauma that have had that big of a change or improvement in outcomes
in that amount of time.

So it's pretty, it's actually pretty special kind of a pathology and
improvement there.

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Yes, sir. I {[}00:09:00{]} encourage one of your
listeners to write that up. It'd be a great review. , you know, two
decade review , , two and a half decade review of, of just the broad
strokes, how that practice has changed and how paraplegia rates are down
on mortality rates.

It's still a highly lethal injury, but if patients make it to the
hospital, as you were referring to , um, modern grading, modern
management techniques, give them a much better chance.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Absolutely. And I, and I'll include all those papers
in the show notes. So you can just go click the links in the show notes
here.

Um, we're going to get back into the kind of management of this. Um,
there's some things that all of these patients are going to need,
whether they're going to get surgery or not. Um, you really want to
focus on anti impulse therapy. And generally you can do it with a beta
blockade and a short acting beta blocker is the best.

Um, so that's going to be as small as generally the, the BA the beta
blocker of choice. And of course you have to talk with your neurosurgery
colleagues. Um, and we're gonna discuss a little bit this more lately,
but. Um, you know, generally want the blood pressure less than 120
systolic. Um, it's, there's no guidelines on that, but it's just sort of
consensus of, of surgeons.

But, you know, {[}00:10:00{]} obviously it depends on their head injury and
other what other issues they have going on. Um, and generally , , As far
as, you know, managing this small tears, the less than 10 millimeter
ones , , the guidelines recommend a CTA within 30 days. If you have a
larger flap, greater than 10 millimeters, this is something you're going
to image sooner.

, generally within seven days. And as Dr.~Kazi pointed out the other day
is that many of these patients are getting rescanned for lots of
different things. Reasons, whether it's their blood organ , , solid
organ injuries and other things, and really kind of try and work it into
one of those or kind of fit the imaging , um, to help them out.

And then , um, if it's an in, we're gonna talk a little more about this
in detail, but if there is an external aortic contour abnormality,
generally, you're going to repair that within less than one week. And
then of course, if the patient is hypotensive and has a hematoma , um,
concerning for a rupture, this should be repaired urgently.

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} One of the things that comes up often I find is that.
Patients who ha who need to have their blood pressure elevated for one
reason or another such as a traumatic brain injury. And if you go back
on the behind the knife conversation , um, a couple of years ago, this
{[}00:11:00{]} was really brought to life as if they need to ramp up the
blood pressure to treat intracranial pathology.

Oftentimes that's going to require a very urgent repair , um, so that,
that blood pressure can be brought up because you will not be able to do
that anti impulse therapy.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Dark there. Are you saying on the, if there is a grade
one injury , um, per the say either, either guidelines, the Starns or
the SPS guidelines , , that you would this, if, and they needed a high
blood pressure for their brain, you'd potentially , , repair it with a T
VAR.

, even though there is no pseudo aneurysm.

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} That's a great question. I think that Dr.~Starnes
covered that a little bit and I'm not gonna speak too much on what he
said, but he found that the intimal terrors at 30 days in that podcast,
that they were not going to need to be re-imaged or repaired at all.

And so he put each of those patients on 325 milligrams of aspirin for 30
days and said in that podcast that he didn't Ramage them. So in that
particular case, no, I would not repair an intimal. Tear. Um, but if it
was a {[}00:12:00{]} significant other type of aortic injury, I think I
would lean towards repairing that.

What are your thoughts, Dr.~Rasmussen?

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Yeah , I, I agree. I think that , um, you know, the,
sort of the grade ones that, , the, the , um, Seattle group has
described,, I, I, I don't think that they , um, You know, parsed out the
patients who might, for example, need a higher cerebral profusion
pressure. And therefore they, they're not as amenable to , , you know,
anti impulse therapy or hypotensive, resuscitation, whatever.

I don't think they really parse that out, but I don't. I also don't. I
also don't think that they, you know, they th th that they recommend or
others around the country recommend, you know , um, Fixing grade one
injuries in, in those patients. I think that they're, if they're grade
one , Um, they, you know , those, those generally don't need to be
treated.

And , , now, I mean, I think there's always room as in all of these
complex situations for,, for, for another CT, you know , for, for a
followup CT to see, I mean, if , , if a provider's really nervous about
it and , , you know, the. The neurosurgeons have had to drive up the
pressure for the {[}00:13:00{]} TBI or, , to, to maintain, , , CPP then,
then , um, you know, you can always image them again to confirm that.

But , , I agree. I think if, if they're a grade one injury , um, right
now they, they, you know, non non-operative therapies is safe and
indicated.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Great. So let's talk a little bit more about the nitty
gritty of actually repairing these things. It's important for , ,
residents out there to understand , , the T-bar devices that are
currently in the market.

Um, these are generally designed for aneurysmal disease and not for the
trauma population. , the Trump populations going to be smaller. They're
going to be , um, Younger and healthier vessels and it's , um, you know,
these devices weren't really made. So the devices that we currently
have, they are, you know, generally require large diameter , , access.

Their compliance is not , , as ideal for these kinds of , , smaller
aortic arches. And the actual size of the devices are relatively large
compared to these aortas. Um, the average size of the aorta proximal to
the injury in a study was shown to be about 19 millimeters. And our
current smallest {[}00:14:00{]} device is about 22 millimeters, which is,
you know, an adequate oversizing, but you wouldn't, you know, that's , ,
only, you know, wouldn't want much bigger than that.

So , , Dr.~W what is your experience with the current generation of
devices?

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} Yeah, I think the good news for a lot of these devices
is that the technology seems to be advancing. To where arch confirmation
is starting to have a lot of technological advances so that the young
patient with the steep aortic arch will better be treated in the coming
decade.

Dr.~Rasmussen, this always brings up an interesting question in regards
to, so the sizing of an Intergraph, so in a patient's injured and
they're in the trauma Bay and they get their CT angiogram. Oftentimes
they're under resuscitated. How do you go about assessing what you think
is the proper size of the order and choosing your endograft.

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} So I think , um, it's a great question. And , um,
one of the things just to add to what you've, what you've said , , Wayne
is that , um, and it really, I think fits with our , um, the, you know,
the line of our discussion about the evolution of, , of, of, not of this
injury pattern. Now our ability to {[}00:15:00{]} have classifications that
are pretty technical , , with degree of injury.

then the evolution of. Of management techniques is now the evolution of
these stent graphs. And, you know , um, one of the, I think things to
keep in mind is that. TEVAR for blunt threat , um, thoracic
endovascular, aneurysm repair T VAR extent graft , , for blunt aortic
injury, you know, a decade ago was done with really very clunky
endograft technology and none of that technology.

Let's say for the, for example, the WST two study that I cited , , the ,
the, the endovascular repairs in that study were often , , you know,
iliac limbs , , for the, you know, not really designed for, for blunt
aortic injury. Now, fast forward to 2020. And we have, for example , ,
one of the devices that is made by Gore is actually has an indication ,
, for , , an aortic transduction.

You know, and so now , , you know , the, the technology , , is really
evolved now to, to suit the, you know, the condition, which is sort of
exciting. And I think gives us as vascular {[}00:16:00{]} surgeons and, and
gives patients a lot better options. Um, maybe we can go over some of
the specific devices , , next, your point, or your question about , um,
you know, imaging is, I think is, is.

Is an important one for listeners to understand. And I think w just to
be clear, what we're talking about is is that if , , if , , Patient's
aorta is imaged in the cat scanner when his or her systolic blood
pressure is 90 and they're relatively hypovolemic then, you know , is,
is the , , how accurate is it has a diameter of 18 millimeters, for
example.

And is that a vasoconstrictive or just a hypovolemic , , aorta. And I
think it is, I think that it is, it is, it is not the greatest , ,
measure and that providers should To keep that in mind that when
patients are resuscitated, that the diameter of the aorta is actually
going to be larger. So usually what I would recommend is to , um, you
know, still oversize, , the, the stent graft by, you know, 20\% or so
based on your original measurement , , again and here , , unlike
aneurysm disease {[}00:17:00{]} where you know, you're trying to.

I think get a seal and it really diseased , um, and dilated aorta here.
, you know, the seals zone in, in the, in the pathology is, is almost
always much more focal. You're really just trying to cover and seal the
proximal intimal tear. Um, and so I think that, you know, oversizing by
roughly 20\% , um, Using intravascular ultrasound or IVUS, I think is
also useful.

Sometimes when you get them, the patient to the, or for the TVR, for the
thoracic endovascular repair, using intravascular ultrasound real time
to confirm or refute your original , um, you know, your original CT scan
is. Is , , is also useful. Um, but I think keeping in mind the blood
pressure and their volume status when the scan was taken oversizing by
somewhere around 20 to 25\% and then using IVIS.

So I think are useful tips. What do you think, or how do you guys do it
in San Antonio? Oh, that's a

great

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} point. I mean , we, we set up IVUS for every single
aortic case so that it can be there. It's mounted to the system and.
{[}00:18:00{]} Even if we don't use it for the particular case, we know that
everything's there and available for us to use it.

If we need to re image or resize and aorta or some other blood vessels
so that it can be adequately sized. I remember one time we had a 17 year
old with a blunt traumatic aortic injury and he needed an emergent
repair and we didn't have the smallest endograft at the hospital, but
fortunately there was a one from a local hospital that could be sent
over, but.

That was a little bit of a troubleshooting. I was, what is, what was I
going to do as far as putting a larger endograft into a relatively
smaller we're to knowing exactly what we talked about that open repair
has much worse outcomes than an endovascular repair. And I think my, the
way I was going to approach that one was I was going to use the IVIS
after I deployed the endograft to make sure I didn't have a retrograde
dissection , , or something , , some major complication related to the
procedure.

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Yeah, I think, I think that also , , Wayne speaks to
the,, um, the,, in, in some ways, and I, I don't want this {[}00:19:00{]} to
be not, I don't want to overstate this, but in some ways this condition
is , um, although the overall patient complexity can be a much greater,
some ways, just the aortic. Pathology is simpler than, than a complex
dilated aortic aneurysm and in an elderly patient.

And, and I think that makes it more amenable to,, , to , um, you know,
sort of belts and suspenders repair, meaning that you just really need
to seal the, the entry point. I mean, again, it's not, I'm not trying to
oversimplify it because it is serious. And these certainly , , some of
these, a grade three or four by imaging can certainly rupture and cause
mortality.

But, but even in the WST two trial in 2000, Eight that was published in
the journal of trauma, the success and the, in the unmistakable , ,
advantage of endo repair over open. That was all using very primitive,
endo materials, you know, as I mentioned , so, you know, I think,, ,
it's really an exciting part of vascular , , practice mascular
{[}00:20:00{]} trauma is, is the evolution of , , of these technologies.

But , , I appreciate, and I agree with, and it definitely used them.
Belts and suspenders sorts of endograft that you got. It's not exactly
the one you want. Um, but you use what you can and just try to seal the,
the proximal portion of the intimal tear.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah. And , , you know, there, there's a lot of
technical aspects of these and , , kind of , , you can miss , um, the
zone you can deploy to proximal, to distal.

One of the issues that comes up and you see sort of in a case reports of
, , you know, malpositioned , , devices is what they call bird beaking
and where the , um, the lesser curve, the graft isn't. Approximated well
, um, to the lesser curve of the aorta and a doctor asked me, said, I
wonder if you had any tips for our listeners , um, on how to avoid a
bird beak.

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Yeah. Great question. A couple of things. Um, so I
wish we could , , illustrate this , , for your listeners. Um, you did a
nice job bird beaking to me and , , you know, you guys jump in or
correct me if you've got a different way to articulate it. On just
{[}00:21:00{]} a call. We don't have a whiteboard , um, bird beaking, as you
said, is the, is sort of the lifting of the inferior aspect of the very
proximal.

, endograft where the fabric is. That that, that ring, if you will, of
stent covered stent lifts up off of the inner curve of the aortic arch.
And if it lifts up, then it's prone to get an, a, you know, the jet of
flow and pressure that then, you know, would cause an endo leak. And so
to get that first covered stent ring to lay down , , so that it doesn't
lift up and cause this, I guess the bird beat comes, cause it sort of
has this appearance of a.

I'm a triangle , , on the, on the imaging, I guess that's where bird big
comes from. Um, to get that, to lay down a couple of things, one , um, I
think getting a stiff wire , um, , , around the outer edge of the art.
So using an Amplatz , , or a lender, Quist wire, that's really , um, all
the way into the aortic root, the ascending aorta and actually
{[}00:22:00{]} pushing it.

Um, so that it's got sort of a constant. Tension that , um, allows you
to get the endograft forward and, you know, making sure that you have a
stiff wire and platform. Is one, you know , that's, that's a basic
principle of endograft deployment anyway, independent of the bird beak.
But I think that helps. And then I think another is to consider if
there's, if it's close or if it's an angulated arch to consider taking
the endograft over, across the origin of the left subclavian artery ,
um, to where the , um, You know, to where the there's more room, if you
will, and a flatter inner arch or inferior aspect of that curvature to
lay the graph down.

So covering the left subclavian, using a stiff wire with forward
pressure on that wire during positioning and deployment. And then the
third thing, you know, some of the, the Gore , , conformable , ,
Thoracic Intergraph now actually has a kind of a ratchet on it that,
that allows one to have some control of that first stent so that you can
actually kind of conform or lay it down.

Um, I think that that's real. Um, {[}00:23:00{]} I'm not quite sure how
effective, I don't know what, you know, Wayne, what you think about the
conformable Gore graft, but I think that maybe another advantage that
comes as graphs that you can actually. Manipulate them when they're in
place and try to lay down that first , , covered stent component.

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} Right? I, I think that's ideal. I mean, we have
recently. Switched all our inventory. So we let the old stuff, you know,
use it or, or expire. And then everything that we purchased now for
blunt, thoracic aortic injury is conformable. And I like to use the
double curve Lundquist. And just like you said, I. I have the assistant
, , whoever's holding the wire actually put forward pressure.

So that, that wire is really snugged against the greater curvature of
the order aorta. And also that the double curve lender request is
basically sitting at the , , at the heart so that it can really give me
as much tension as I can. And I think that bringing it across less of
cleaving, if you think it's going to be bird beak is, {[}00:24:00{]} is.

Absolutely essential that if you need to cover it so that you don't have
it sitting oddly on the inner curvature, that that's ideal. And I agree
with you a hundred percent.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah. So , , another kind of issue , , that we can
sometimes run into in our trauma patients is getting the devices there.
Um, some of the iliac arteries are , , relatively small.

Um, you know, granted the devices are getting smaller themselves, but
Dr.~Rasmussen, do you have a size , , that you would consider doing an
Elliot conduit , , for these graphs? Is there kind of a rule of thumb
with our current generation?

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} That's a great idea. A great question. A great idea.
Sometimes to do it in Elliot conduit, if you need it.

I think , um, Boy, I hate to , , to wimp out and just say it depends.
Um, so I would say that, you know, if , if, if the iliac , um, but it
does, but it does depend , um, you know, it depends on the age of the
patient. I mean, if they're calcium free , um, you know, it's a young
patient, like many or most of our trauma patients , um, and the iliac
is, you know , um, Seven millimeters or greater.

Um, and it's sort of a straight shot we'll give it a try. seven.
{[}00:25:00{]} To eight millimeters is sort of on the small side of this.
Um, but I will often, but if it's calcium free in, in a young patient,
then, you know, w w we'll try it through the, through , , through the
femoral without a conduit.

Um, I think that if gets smaller than that, if it's a female and they're
hypotensive, when the images come through and you, you know, you're
ultrasounding them in the, or using duplex to size up their common
femoral and you, you know, whether it's shock or just they're native,
they're just small. If it gets to be, you know, less than six or seven
millimeters, then I think , , You know , , exposing either the common
femoral or the external iliac through retroparotoneil approach and
putting on a Dacron conduit is it's easy enough , , and should be done.

Um, So it depends, but you know, the flip side, I guess , , Kevin is
that if it's , , you know, if there's a lot of calcium and it's an
elderly patient and it looks like there's atherosclerosis, then I have a
lower threshold to put on a conduit because you know, you could cause
problems. It's not as accommodating of a passage of the sheet.

If they're, if they're calcified or {[}00:26:00{]} highly

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} ambulant, Yeah, I think if it measures seven on the
seat, the angiogram and the trauma Bay, that it's likely, like you said,
if it's not calcified and not diseased and not injured, otherwise it's,
it's a good chance that you're gonna be able to deliver that endograft
without any difficulty.

Um, you may, I sometimes consider, I use do a most percutaneously, but
cut down on the femoral artery, just like you said, just to make sure
that it's delivered safely. And if there's a problem with removing it,
that I'm ready to fix it.

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} I think that's a great point. If it's a small one
and you feel like you're kind of right on that edge, then I have a low
threshold to just cut down.

And that way, you know, you afford yourself, I think a little bit , um,
more assured sort of placement sure. Placement with an open, which is
also relatively easy or should be, , to, to do it open the other. The
other thing, I don't know if you've used, I sometimes will oil the
sheets with mineral oil, you know, I'll put it on the.

On the , , I mean, you know, the other question here we haven't really
talked about is heparin heparin eyes or not. We can get to that, but
sometimes I'll get some mineral oil on the back, you know, and I'll just
cover the sheath. If you think {[}00:27:00{]} it's going to be tight and
sort of make that , um, make the sheath as you're passing it from the
femoral up the, the small externally, like into the end of the AOR to
make it slick, if you will.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah, you , , are reading our minds, sir. So I was
actually going to bring this question to Dr.~Kazi. Um, many of these
patients are multi injured as we've discussed and have , , head
injuries, maybe even head bleeds. Um, do you recognize in all of these
cases, is there cases where you won't

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} have her nice? Well, it's interesting in our group, we
have a variation of practice patterns.

, I guess number one is if the neurosurgeon or someone. Completely
contraindicate you to using heparin. And then you're a little bit in a
bind. I haven't really found that to be largely the case, but it does
come up every now and then I personally like to Hep denies, even if it's
just a little bit of heparin , um, 3000 of heparin, just to , , allow me
to have the optimal device, but I don't think it's necessary.

One of the things that you and I discussed recently because we repaired
A symptomatic AAA three days ago on a COVID positive patient. Kevin was,
we were concerned about the thrombosis {[}00:28:00{]} with the large sheets.
Um, Dr.~Rassman, what do you think with the COVID patients , um, and
heparin in general , , do you, do you have denies all of your T VARs and
what ha what if you had a COVID positive patient?

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} That's a great question. I mean, I think , um, You
know , I, I remember , um, my first sort of TVRS for blunt aortic injury
when I was in San Antonio and I was amazed at , um, how. Um, if the
patient's condition allows it , , and I think most of them do , ,
operative planning. So imaging , , trying to get some resuscitation,
maybe even, you know, a 12 to 24 hour delay and the repair.

If you get everything lined up and it's a straightforward , , repair ,
um, how you, you can really get these stent grafts in and. Sort of 30
minutes or less. Um, I don't, I don't want to exaggerate or tell a fish
story here. So I , , you know, I know it's never as quick as we surgeons
think it is, but the point is if you can get it done quickly and the
patient has other , , contraindications, a head bleed, solid organ
injury, you know, big hematoma and a fractured femur or {[}00:29:00{]}
something, then I think they can be done safely without heparin.

Um, and I think , um, one just needs to be mindful of the time. Um, and
then really flushing out the femoral and then assessing the access side
or site , , when you're done. Um, so I think they can be done safely
without heparin. Um, now the, the flip side is if the patient has no
solid organ injury, TBI hematoma, and the thigh from a femur fracture ,
then, then proceeding with the use of heparin is it would be preferred.

You know, I think that's always preferred. Um, so I think, you know, I
guess what I would say is I would prefer to use heparin. I do in all the
cases that I can , , but I don't sweat it too much if I can't, because
of other conditions, the patient has other injuries. I just am more
attentive to the time my sheets are in.

And then to what's happened. What's the status of the Elio femoral
segment. After I've removed the sheets. I think in COVID positive
patients, I think they've shown {[}00:30:00{]} themselves to be relatively
hypercoagulable and I would , , I would want to I'd, you know, I I'd
have a more , um, you know , , th I think the imperative to
anticoagulate coagulate, those patients would be higher because of their
, , shown propensity to develop , , thrombus.

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} Yeah, that's exactly what Kevin and I did with that
endo AAA patient is we pepper to them more than we normally would. And
then followed act pretty closely to make sure they stayed over two 50,

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} a really good point. And we didn't really mention
it, but the act, the activated clotting time, I think, you know, we
talked about operative planning and, you know, for your listeners, I
think.

You know, we tell our trainees the best, the best resident, the best
surgeons are pessimists. You know, it sounds bad. I don't want to be a
downer before the holidays, but you have to anticipate things going
wrong and never be the optimist. Right. , if I have a major injury or
condition, I want my doctor to be worried that everything's going to go
wrong.

, I'm exaggerating a little bit to make the point. The part of that is
the act machine. Like how many times have we been in the employment? And
we need an activated clotting time because we really, whether it's for
carotid or endarterectomy or this type of an {[}00:31:00{]} injury, and you
know, the, our staff, our anesthesia colleagues, not necessarily to a
fault of theirs, they'll say, Oh, we don't basically team.

Machine's not working. Or we don't have it or something. Right. So part
of the pre-op planning for, for house officers is, you know, among all
the other things is where's the act machine. And could we draw a test
act before the case starts because Dr.~Kazi really needs the act on this
one. And , um, the last time you, you know, the worst time to hear ,
well, the act machine is not available.

It doesn't work. Cause when you've got a, you know, an 18 French sheath
up a small iliac and an undergrad in the order, So I agree with the act
and , , I don't want to sound too much like a pessimist. Maybe I'm just
a realist , um, that, you know, putting that on the pre-op timeout, for
example, if you're going to do team steps or time out , , make sure that
you're you're you got that act lined up.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah, absolutely. , so there's two kind of main points
we want to cover here , , to wrap up , topic. And one of them is the
subclavian artery. And as we discussed before, the average distance
between the injury and {[}00:32:00{]} a subclavian is about 5.8 millimeters.
And most of these devices recommend a two centimeter coverage and
healthy vessel.

Um, and then two centimeters distal in order to adequate coverage. so.
And , and, and using those numbers, the registry suggests about 40\% of
patients have their subclavians covered in these cases. So, Dr.
Rasmussen, what are your thoughts on covering subclavian artery? Do you
, um, do anything to revascularize it AF if you do , , cover it and any,
any thoughts you have on this?

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Yeah. Great question. this also has evolved , , and
I think can be institution specific. Although I think most institutions
now have gone to not. ,, um, preemptively, revascularizing the
subclavian. So maybe for, if we take a step back , , I don't want to
take too much time, but I think for your listeners, what we're talking
about here is , is, is covering with that covered stent.

So you've got to get that covered stent graft up over. In into the
distal part of the aortic arch to seal to {[}00:33:00{]} get a good two
centimeter length of seal before that aortic tear that happened most
commonly at the aortic isthmus. Right. And so sometimes that requires
covering the left subclavian artery. And while that seems crazy, most
patients do just fine with that.

Actually they may have a little bit of arm claudication, but do just
fine. And what that allows us to do is to then get that two centimeters
of seal. , where the stent graph is really well. Well, opposed to the
inner curve of the aortic arch, if you will, , or, or the outer curve.,
the, the things that I think about, I think , , where's the vertebral
artery.

So the, so the risks of covering the left side, Clarion, I mentioned arm
, , arm claudication , um, or Ms.~Schema, so real close attention to , ,
and then another complication could be stroke. Right. So that , um, if ,
if, if the patient has, , , the dominant vertebral artery is on the left
and it comes off the left subclavian, and for some reason they don't
have a right to vertebral, then you really need to revasc you've got to,
you can't cover the left subclavian without {[}00:34:00{]} revascularizing.

Um, you know , um, that subclavian and the verge , um, so paying
attention to where the w what the, the dominant vert is, where it's
from, what is the right vertebral artery look like? Is there
atherosclerotic disease in the arch and the great vessels to include the
birds? And then the third main complication is spinal cord ischemia ,
um, and weirdly , , you know, for your listeners, you think , well, how
can covering the left subclavian lead to spinal cord ischemia?

Um, and if you. Think back to how our spinal cord is perfused. Um, it is
rare in a very it's uncommon , but, but there are collateral pathways
through the, through the Ima, the internal mammaries and to, through
other,, , collateral circulations that originate off the subclavian.
Whereas subclavian profusion can be important to perfuse the spine.

So, you know, Making sure that you have those three things in mind, left
arm, claudication, posterior circulation, stroke, spinal cord ischemia.
And as long as you have those front and center , um, you know, most of
the time you can still cover that left subclavian {[}00:35:00{]} without.
Revascularizing it. And you will be cognizant of the situations where
you do need to revascularize it either before you do the T bar or at the
same time.

Um, or sometimes afterwards.

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} Yeah, this is always an interesting situation,
particularly some more rare scenarios that often comes up as well as , ,
as you said, the right for T-ball already may be occluded. There's a
dialysis access and the left arm or the one that concerns me the most is
if there's a Lima to an LA , , I don't, I agree. I agree.

I don't think there's an easy answer on these. , we have , , laser
finished rated a few endograft for these rare cases with pretty good
result. And I do think that there's some graphs on the horizon. That's
going to allow us to preserve that left subclavian artery , um, in the

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} future. Really good point about the Lima. So for the
listeners, that means that the patient's had a cabbage and they've got
their eyes left. Ima going into the, for example, anterior , , or to
the, into a coronary. So you can't, you know, you can't cover that
without you might cause a M I, {[}00:36:00{]} And I think good point on the
future of the graphs, I think we do have already branch graphs that , ,
may not yet be approved for trauma, but they're probably coming, which
will help.

And did we talk about, or maybe I'll ask a question. I don't know if
that's fair. , , Kevin and Wayne, but did we talk about spinal cord
drainage? I mentioned, you know, spinal cord ischemia and a rare
incidence in paraplegia, you know, do you guys , , in San Antonio
preemptively , , do spinal cord drainage , , for blunt aortic injuries
that you're going to put an undergrad in or not?

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} , no. Um, in general, it's thought that , , likely due
to the short distance of coverage with these graphs, that there's not a
lot of , , intercostals that are kind of covered and putting the spinal
cord at risk. I think the, the risk of spinal cord ischemia is extremely
low in these cases, but it's something you certainly.

Have to have in mind and have your anesthesia team or neurosurgery
colleagues , um, aware of and available for , , should the situation
change. And so certainly a motor in {[}00:37:00{]} neuro exam at the
conclusion of the case is critical. And I think we would respond , ,
with , , elevating the blood pressures and , um, you know, potentially
placing a spinal drain if there was concern for , , spinal cord ischemia
, , following the case, but , , routinely , , we do not.

um , And, and that's sort of our kind of algorithm for that. How about
you, Dr.~Mucin?

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Yeah, I agree. I don't have a whole lot more to add.
We do it selectively very uncommonly and that's also because of the
risks associated with , , placing a spinal cord drain. You know, those
aren't minimal both placing the drain and then monitoring it
effectively.

Um, I think we've got away from that. I think it is important for your
listeners to understand also that. And I think you referred to this,
that the risk of spinal cord ischemia, when you cover, you know, a
segment of the, of the, of the descending thoracic aorta, the risk is
low because we're not paving the entire or such a long segment.

But the risk is , , you know, it's out there for what, 24 hours, 48
hours. So there's a rare, you know, again, thinking about being a
{[}00:38:00{]} pessimist , , I guess I should get away from that term. That
sounds bad around the holidays. I'm not trying to be , , but you know,
the resident's house officers, you have to realize that, that the
patients who, for example, come out of the, or with a normal neuro exam,
there is an incidence it's low to 3\%.

But patients who can develop spinal cord ischemia like 24 or 48 hours or
even 72 hours later. So we really have to be mindful of, of the spinal
cord ischemia complication, even though it's uncommon.

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} Yeah, I think the post-operative care can't be
understated. The fact that you avoid hypotension, you make sure that the
patient's properly resuscitated.

And if there is any concern for a neurologic , , event that's occurring,
that you have a system in place to where a lumbar drain can be placed
relatively expeditiously. A couple of things that come to mind. When I
think about spinal drains, particularly for elective cases are someone
who's had a priority repair , , Chronic {[}00:39:00{]} kidney disease to a
significant degree, stage four or five, or even in stage renal disease.

And , um, and whether I'm going to need to cover a large segment. And
luckily for most aortic injuries, you're talking 10 centimeters for a
covered endograft. And so again, that's going to be the, the shortest
device that's available. And so it's going to give you the lowest risk.
As far as an aortic coverage standpoint occurs.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} those are great points and things to keep in mind when
, , fixing these patients. , so as we wrap up a blunt, thoracic aortic
injury, we're going to cover one of the more important points. There's a
lot of important points here. , but this one , , is the timing of the
repair. Um, You know, generally it was thought initially that, you know,
you should repair these sooner rather than later.

Um, but Dr.~Rasmussen, , what, what are your thoughts on the timing?
And, and specifically, I think we're referring to the, kind of the, the
SVS grade three, the pseudo aneurysms, , what, what are your thoughts on
the timing of repair of these.

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Um, so another great topic, great question in this,
, , pertaining to this injury pattern.

I think that , um, you know, I think that I'll start with the premise
that {[}00:40:00{]} delayed repair is, is certainly feasible. Um, in many
cases and in. Many cases it's preferable. And so , um, that's sort of
the premise of , of, of the answer and delayed repair, meaning 24 to 48
hours later is feasible and preferable in many cases.

Um, I want to be careful because there's certainly some cases , , where
it's, you know , , a grade four or a grade three that's, that's evolving
into a four , , where the patient, you know, the delayed repair is not.
Feasible, , um, but I think that Delaine w what we've understood, I
think with our experience broadly on this , um, in the U S is that once
you get a patient under your.

Care in, into your ICU. If they have a grade three repair and they've
survived that far and you now can get them on anti impulse therapy, um ,
and, and appropriate resuscitation, that, that waiting 24 hours again is
safe and, and preferable. , and I think the majority of cases,, and, and
why is that?

Well, I think it's because it allows us to do good. {[}00:41:00{]} Operative
planning. We've, we've mentioned sort of the team steps, if you will,
the things that we want to troubleshoot and anticipate for the repair ,
, whether it's size of vessel access assembling the right endograft the
right team to include spinal cord drainage or what, you know, the whole
thing.

I think we do a better job. We're giving ourselves 24 to 36 hours, for
example. And I think it also allows patients other injuries to be
stabilized. So whether that's a serious TBI , um, you know, long bone
fracture, solid organ injury, , , I think it, it helps us. So , um, so I
think Delaine is, is , is, is feasible.

We've just published. I, we mentioned. Well mentioned a whole lot of
papers here, but , , there is a paper in the journal of vascular surgery
, , that is a large assessments and just came out in the journal of
vascular surgery, Ramon. , is the senior author, Dr.~most of you know,
is that you, the university of Texas health science center, and it's a
great paper for a lot of reasons.

It's, it's the timing of repair for blunt aortic injuries. So it's this
{[}00:42:00{]} paper addresses exactly your question. Um, it's a great paper
cause it's got a trauma and vascular surgeons on it. , Bryan Eastridge,
Don Jenkins are on it. , but it's got some really , , awesome , ,
vascular surgery fellows from Cleveland clinic who did this when they
were in Cleveland.

, and what that analysis of the national trauma DataBank shows is, is
just that is that it's actually a survival benefit associated with
delayed repair. Um, and I won't go into the paper. Your readers can look
at JBS and, and Ramon, Dr.~, , , is you can sort of pub met him, or we
can send that paper out on your, on your , , to your listeners , but,
but it does show that there's a survival benefit for those who have a
greater than 24 hour.

, delay in their TVR. And that's, there's an analysis that we did in
that paper that, that controls for severity of injury, you know, meaning
that it's not just because those with less severe injuries , um, survive
longer. there's undoubtedly some survivor ship. Bias and that , ,
definitely acknowledged that, but it, but that paper speaks to its at
large NTDB {[}00:43:00{]} analysis of this injury and it speaks to the,
value of , of, of trying to delay repair if possible.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah, I think it's a really important , , topic , um,
to have published the data on, because I think many surgeons and ER docs
, and, and when they hear of a aortic transection or pseudo aneurysm
feel , um, and they may pressure , , vascular surgeons to, you know, get
in there and fix it. And I think , , knowing this information is
critical and supportive of our community.

Yeah.

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} And the, and the delay also allows you to. Really get
an idea of what's the constellation of the Andrew patterns that are
occurring. I mean , if, if there's some infectious process that's
concomitantly going on with the injured patient's care that can an
infected endograft and the thoracic order can be a nearly.

If not insurmountable problem to try to tackle and , , repair. Um, we, I
can remember one case where the endograft was infected and before we
could even wrap our hands around it, the aorta had ruptured and the
patient ended up succumbing to their injuries. But{[}00:44:00{]} , , th th
delaying it by a little bit of time affords you the opportunity to
really gather as much information as you can, to make the best decision
on when and how to prepare the aorta.

Yeah.

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Yeah. And some of the delays, I mentioned 24 hours,
but I think Wayne is you're pointing out. It can also be seven days,
right. It can be, you know, as long as no, the thing is that, you know,
you can't ignore the patient, you got to still stick with anti impulse
therapy.it's , and you know, very meticulous care cause you can.

You know, there are cases certainly where a delay, you know, can fail,
you know, and those are cases where we lose track of their blood
pressure and, and , , you know, something happens in the, or for a femur
fracture or something, and we lose track and , , we're not communicating
as a multidisciplinary team and you can turn a stable.

, you know, grade three injury that you're observing for four, three or
four or five days into one that ruptures that's were very rare. But
again , , we want to be mindful of, of , , just because we're delaying
doesn't mean you get a free pass until the, or, and , , five {[}00:45:00{]}
days

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} later. Right? I think if I may, personally, if I'm
going to be watching.

, grade three aortic injury , um, up to seven days that patient's going
to stay in the ICU with very close monitoring that entire time until the
time of the repair.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} These are fantastic points. And I think we really
covered blunt, thoracic aortic injury , , quite in depth. And I think
our listeners will really enjoy this.

We have two more topics that are much briefer to cover here as we close
out the endovascular management of trauma. Um, so we're gonna move down
the order a little bit. We're going to do below the diaphragm, and this
is pretty rare, but there are. Important to keep this in mind. Um, the
blunt abdominal aortic injuries in the endovascular approach to this.

Um, so many times it's a similar sort of patient population as the , ,
thoracic aortic injuries , , where it's a multiple injured trauma. And
when we described the blunt abdominal work injury, they in, in repairing
it for endovascular, there's three zones that are thought of , um, and
the numbers ones, and three are the ones that you can repair , um,
endovascular.

So the zone one is from the diaphragm down to the SMA. Um, zone
{[}00:46:00{]} two is the SMA and renal arteries are relatively small
segment, but , , that's the zone two. And then zone three is from the
inferior renal inferior to the renal arteries, to the aortic
bifurcation. Um, so. Zone one and zone three, you know, above , , from
above the SMA two.

And then also below the renal arteries are the two areas that are
amenable to endovascular repair.

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} Yeah. Fortunately, Kevin, these things are
extraordinarily uncommon. I mean, most vascular surgeons at level one
trauma centers, I would wager can count on one or two hands, depending
on how old they are. The number of these injuries they've had to manage
from an endovascular standpoint.

I think Dr.~Rasmussen, what do you think about coverage of the celiac
artery? Um, and what are the factors you think about if you had to
prepare something in that area?

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Yeah, I think that , um, I think there's increasing
, um, literature, including I think , , an article and I'm just, won't
pull the journal here, but I think it's.

Yeah, it's this November , , JVs about the feasibility and safety of
covering the celiac artery it's {[}00:47:00{]} what's in this month. JBS is
not pertaining to trauma, but it's talking about , , covering the celiac
for , , for T VAR EMR, for example, for aneurysm disease. I think we're
learning that you can cover the celiac safely.

In many cases, I think it, it reminds me of what the left subclavian was
10 years ago. No, no, we were a little nervous. We knew there were some
patients you couldn't cover it in. And now 10 years later, we pretty
routinely covered that left subclavian. , and I think the celiac artery
is similar. It reminds me of that.

I think in patients, obviously you've got to look at the make sure
they've got and SMA , , probably an Ima and then internal iliac
arteries, you know, looking at the blood supply to the whole of their
mesentery. And if any of that's compromised, then that would give me.
Um, you know, pause, certainly if they've had a, you know, a gastrectomy
here or some unusual intra-abdominal operation, that's interrupted their
bowel.

If you will, the gut circulation that would give me pause to cover the
celiac. Um, you know, but otherwise I think if it really gets you out of
a {[}00:48:00{]} jam , , which these injuries are like, so yeah, you're
right. Wayne, they're pretty rare, but man , they're, they're really
hard to. Try to repair open. So that gets a person out of a jam and you
need to cover the celiac.

I think he can.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah. I think those are fantastic points. And, you
know, just like with the , , thoracic injuries and other, you know,
situation where you have to be prepared to respond , um, with a bypass,
potentially if, if , um, you know, you have a schema that you didn't
expect. Um, and so it's just things to keep in mind.

And one thing I think the we like talked about here is the IVIS is also
very helpful. It's kind of like a, with. Dissection cases. A lot of
these cases are sort of , um, kind of variants of dissections of, of the
traumatic. And so the IVIS can really help characterize this. You can
help identify these large intimal flaps , um, in pseudo aneurysms or , ,
kind of, and see the branches and help plan your stint graft placement
all with IVIS.

So, So, one thing to keep in mind when, especially if these patients
might not tolerate a lot of contrasts and other kind of situation to
keep in mind, this is an, a patient with significant Tesla. Intestinal
contamination , , the endovascular approach to this {[}00:49:00{]} would
help , , eliminate any or. You know, minimize any risk of contamination.

, so Dr.~Kazi, as far as the types of graphs , um, that you're thinking
of when you have a patient , , what are you using? Are you using Tavarez
covered since Eric cuffs? What's your preferred method?

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} My preferred method is to use whatever. Means is going
to cover the least amount of aorta, but still seal the injury.

Um, so the answer to that is, yes, I I'd use all of them. Um, some of
the newer covered balloon expandable and post dilatable stints have
changed our management, particularly in the smaller aorta is at our
level one trauma center. We carry. Basically the entire catalog of
balloon expandable coverage stents.

, one that Kevin recently showed me , um, was we did an iliac branch
case last week and the , , covered stent. I didn't realize started up.
It started eight millimeters and goes all the way up to 11. I'm sorry.
16 millimeters. Previously, it was a 11 millimeter stent that could be
post dilated up to 16. So in the smaller aorta is , , I think these have
a role , um, and being able to post dilate them.

The {[}00:50:00{]} question is how to keep it in place when you're post
dilating it so that it doesn't move. And so if that's a concern, then
oftentimes I will go to a, , , thoracic graft or an aortic cuff or , ,
something that I know is going to deploy and stay stable the entire
time.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} And I think , , now we're going to move into our final
topic of the day is XLO sub cleaving injuries and endovascular
management.

We chose these three topics is endovascular care has really kind of in
some ways revolutionized , , the management of these. And so , um, as we
know the injuries to the XL, subclavian is very rare. And it's likely
due to the protective nature of the skeleton, but the fact of the
skeleton there also makes it very difficult to obtain proximal and
distal control.

So , , Dr.~Kazi, if you have a patient with some kind of contained some
Flavian injury , um, and you're going to approach this from an
endovascular approach , , H w what approach do you prefer to, to access
this.

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} My preferred approach is from the arm, if at
{[}00:51:00{]} all possible , um, that could either be brachial or radio.

Um, depending on the, again, if you have a covered stent that can be
post dilated to a size that can be delivered through a seven French
sheath, and you can use a, a radial access for those patients in that ,
, Can be done percutaneously with low risk. Otherwise I do like to cut
down on the brachial artery, if I'm , um, going to the brachial artery
for trauma just seems to be more reliable for me and sometimes even
quicker.

But, , I, I like the brachial approach, but sometimes I'll do both the
brachial and the femoral approach , , and combine that with a through
wire. If I have a really tough or challenging aortic arch and I need to
deliver something. Say to the proximal, right. Subclavian. Um, and
you've got , , a type three arch or something to that effect.

And I liked the through wire.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Great. And so as far as you know, like discussing our
stint options here, and I I've heard , , debates even on Twitter about
this, about whether to use a self-expanding scent, because it might give
you more flexibility, especially if it's in the axillary artery , um,
versus balloon expandable , um, more precise {[}00:52:00{]} deployment,
especially if near kind of branch vessels.

Um, Dr.~SBS. And do you have a, do you have a preferred stint or do you
just base it on the situation?

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} I think that we , um, had , , you know, I think
initially we aired. Um, and well, I don't know, we erred on the side of
self-expanding initially, if you think back , um, you know, when we
first started treating this injury pattern with endo techniques covered
stents, all of the covered stents available were self-expanding.

We didn't really have , um, you know, 10, 15 years ago, we didn't have
viable , um, Balloon expandable covered stents. And so I think, you
know, therefore that's what we got used to, whether it was the via Bon
or the old fluency or whatever the self-expanding. And so we got used to
that and I think more recently in the last three to four, five years , ,
there's now , um, really nice balloon expandable covered stents, which
are flexible, I think it's dealer's choice in a lot of ways. I do think
there is truth to , um, balloon expandable for more precise landing. You
know, I just think that {[}00:53:00{]} premise of stenting is holds true,
meaning that if you gotta really nail something , , you know, close to a
Lima an internal mammary , um, for you read in relation to the
vertebral.

Um, you know, blue expandable is I think more accurate if it's , , more
distally and needed in a longer stand in the axilla than using a
self-expanding is just fine. Another thing that, you know, I think you
may get to, but sometimes there's you need to come from both right.

The arm, retro grade. Um, but if he can't retrograde, you know,
sometimes coming antegrade , um, for imaging and sometimes to , to, to
really make that connection between the disruption but coming from the
groin into the. Origin of the subclavian axillary , , antegrade is, is
needed as well.

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} one of my techniques for that was to have a through
wire. So I had snare wire and the descending thoracic aorta. especially
for challenging arch. Then I would come across with a sheath from the
femoral artery and then deploy my stint with a through wire. Um, and
that I felt, gives me a pretty {[}00:54:00{]} precise deployment , ,
particularly if I'm really trying to nail something.

And I want to make sure that there's no curves or bends and that the
stent delivery. Which is usually a little stiffer than the sheath is
going to be able to make it around and be very precise. Particularly if
you're trying, like you said, nail on a vertebral artery or , um, and
Ima

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} yeah, we had one where we, our last one we did here,
a couple of my partners are pretty crafty and skilled and, and we, we
actually had to put us , , we had to, I think we used a snare, right.

from the arm. We couldn't get , , the wire to make the approach. So we
put a aim up, you know, antegrade through the lifts of Clayton, got a
snare sort of out there, and we're able to snare the free wire and bring
it through. That's pretty rare, pretty uncommon. Um, but you know , , I
think those are all techniques that we're learning , , for the, kind of
the fringes of these injury patterns, which used to be too severe for us
to treat with endo.

And now we're actually finding with technology and experience that
actually you can, you can treat the vast majority of these. {[}00:55:00{]}

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah. These are , , A lot, a lot of options and things
are going to continue to evolve as our technology improves. It's kind of
a theme of this episode. ,

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} I seem to find that when people have these injuries
there, for some reason that maybe this is just my own experience, it
seems to be that they're more contra-indicated for anticoagulation.

I don't know if it's because the , , nature of the injury to injure
something in the, you know, in the. Bony thorax, such as scapulothoracic
dissociation or a sub claiming artist, pseudo aneurysm. I remember I can
remember there's cases where the central line goes in for a head injured
patient because they need to monitor their CVPs.

Um, I prefer to have a brachial open approach to that. And when I can't
give anticoagulation, just because I can, then I'm set up to do an
embolectomy if need be for the brachial artery.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Yeah, I think that, I think that's a great point. And
just wrap this up, and as far as discussing, you know, options you have
from the endovascular approach, there really it's up to your
imagination.

, , you know , , whether it's {[}00:56:00{]} approximate rights of Cleveland
injury, approximal, left, subclavian and injury. Um, you know, you can
use a hybrid approach. I I've seen multiple examples of , , large
hematomas where , , proximal, distal control are obtained , , whether
it's over a three wire from the arm.

Um, and then you can approach it open. Um, it really helps in that
situation. Um, I know , , recently we had a case where we did some
parallel stinting of the brachiocephalic in order to, to treat injury.,
and, and you can even use , , the approach to embolize. You can embolize
the subclavian arteries , um, and you know, and do things , , with.

As long as you're respecting the people already. So , , keep in mind,
you know, there's not one kind of recipe for treating these exits of
Cleveland injuries , um, and really kind of adjusting it to the patient.
you know, kind of the last thing I'll mention is , , sometimes these
patients, you know, would probably do better with a bypass, especially
with some axillary artery injuries.

You know, it's going to be in a pretty mobile spot , , but they're too
sick. And so , , I've seen it even done where they use a stint graph to
temporize things, to keep inline flow. And then at a more stable time,
maybe a week, a month later, take them back and perform the bypass

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} {[}00:57:00{]} before you end. I don't want to get you ,
, let you off the hook.

I think the question for you guys and your listeners and , and, and this
may be the most important question of our discussion is to what degree
does it, should we in the military? Try to take these endo technologies
into our deployed hospitals. Um, we've just discussed a range of
injuries in which patients do better.

Right? So they bleed less. They're often less , , less frequently
paralyzed from T-bar for example , , they survive more, they , , with
these endo technologies. So are we telling ourselves that that's okay
for civilians off the street in the U S. , but not good enough. , but,
but our, what our service members have to just kind of get by and the
deployed range.

Do you know when they're down range with these injuries or is it our
responsibility to develop systems of casualty care in which we can take
these technologies down range? What do you think?

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} Yeah, I think that's a great point. I mean , um,
Obviously the farther {[}00:58:00{]} out you get. So like when I was in a
Ford surgical team in Afghanistan, we, it took us three months to get ,
um, the most primitive x-ray machine you could think of.

And just to get a chest x-ray to see if there was a pneumothorax. But
when you get back to the rural three , um, level, which for everyone,
for the listeners, that's a combat support hospital. So there were, for
instance, there would be one in Baghdad. So there's one that triages to
the next level of care from all the forward surgical teams to a combat
support hospital.

There's, there's two in Afghanistan, for instance, but , um, They don't
are always equipped with endovascular technologies as Dr.~Rasmussen's
really alluding to. And as a matter of fact, there, there are going to
be no thoracic endo to repair there's. Um, the capabilities is digital
subtraction angiography. Um, usually it best to say, you know, treat a
bypass.

Yeah. But I do think that one of the things we brought up in this
podcast and Dr.~Brass means I'd be interested in your, your thoughts is
that we have demonstrated that there is a delayed {[}00:59:00{]} timing of
repair for a Arctic injuries. And I do think that deployment and placing
an, a thoracic endograft or a covered stent.

In say Germany, Walter Reed or San Antonio is much better than trying to
do the same thing in Baghdad or bog room or Kandahar Afghanistan,
because , um, there are the, a septic techniques are not going to be the
same there as they are here. And the bacteria and the microorganisms
that exist in those environments are also significantly different than
what we experienced in the United States.

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Yeah, I think it's a great question. And, you know,
I kinda, I get a little bit fired up about it. Um, I know you've got a
lot of young, you know , you've, you've guys got the future , , who are
your listeners? You know, and I think there there's a ton of , um, brain
power, you know, intellectual capacity that listens to this , , and it's
to your guys's credit.

I think it's, it's going to be up to, to the next generation, right. To
figure out. How do we integrate , , endo {[}01:00:00{]} technologies for
wartime scenarios and , um, you know, and I think to it's , it's, it's
like it's too big of a topic to answer that with one question. But I
think if you take it in , in, in, in sort of intervals and you say ,
well, in the near term, right?

So from now to 2022, 2023, Maybe all we can do is get like what you
said, Wayne. Let's make sure we have vascular go teams on the West coast
and the East coast. , who can go into the Pacific or the European
theater, African theater , , with endo stuff. Right? So that if, if we
can't get a casually back, we can , um, you know, figure out what we can
do in the near term.

But, you know, in the, in the, in the midterm, whose fault is it that
there's no digital subtraction NGO to rule three? Is that, do we just
going to blame it on the system and say, it's a damn shame. Where is
that our fault? Right. Cause we're not articulating this. And I think,
you know , we, we should think about that.

I think that, yes. , so you know, most of the time a covered stent for
sure. Yeah, absolutely. Wayne. I mean, you'd definitely rather have a
T-bar and, you know, Germany or , , {[}01:01:00{]} Walter Reed or bamse
than, than in Ballade or Bodrum, Afghanistan, for example. But some
patients can't wait. Right. And so. You know, how do we establish an
endo specific trauma inventory and get it into the cash?

Right? So the, for the select cases who can't wait, what if it's a type
three or type four , , blunt, aortic injury, do we then commit that
service member to, you know, an antiquated treatment, maybe , , if it's
a one cause, and it's particularly relevant in this discussion, because
you've mentioned injury patterns that can be highly lethal, but are
particularly amenable.

To end of therapies, you know, and there's no answer to it. And I don't
mean to get too fired up, but I, I'm excited to sort of pose that
question to the young and innovative, you know, listeners that you guys
have to help us think about. What does a trauma specific endo inventory,
how can it be brought to, you know, resource limited circumstances or
scenarios to, to provide the benefit that these technologies have to
some of these patients.

It's great discussion. And {[}01:02:00{]} I really appreciate the
opportunity to spend some time with, , , with you guys. , and, and , ,
it's been fun.

\textbf{Kevin Kniery:} Absolutely. And doctor asked me to sing. You have to
thank you for this entire series for joining us and taking time out of
your very busy schedule to get down and dirty and talk very specific and
very technical.

Um, I think this will be a resource for years to come for both the
listeners of behind the knife and audible bleeding. So thank you. Thank
you again, and thank you, Dr.~Kazi for joining us and helping us with
this discussion. Yeah. Thanks

\textbf{Wayne Causey:} Kevin.

\textbf{Todd Rasmussen:} Stay safe and stay well.

\section{Planning access creation}\label{planning-access-creation}}

Management of Dialysis access is an important topic of discussion, not
only because it is a significant part of board examinations, but also
because healthcare costs continue to rise for ESRD patients,
particularly during the transition from CKD to ESRD. This is attributed
to use of dialysis catheters and frequent hospitalizations for
arteriovenous access failures and related procedures.

The National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative
(NKF-KDOQI) and SVS has provided guidelines in the follow
areas:\citep{nationalkidneyfoundation2015, sidawy2008}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Timing of referral to access surgeons
\item
  Operative strategies to maximize placement of autogenous AV accesses
\item
  First choice for autogenous access
\item
  Choice of AV access when a patient is not a suitable candidate for a
  forearm autogenous access
\item
  The role of monitoring and surveillance of AV access management
\item
  Conversion of a prosthetic AV access to a secondary autogenous AV
  access
\item
  Management of nonfunctional or failed AV access
\end{itemize}

\textbf{This brings us to the question, who needs dialysis access?}

Patients should be referred to a vascular surgeon for access when their
creatinine clearance is \textless25mL/min which is CKD stage 4. You want to
provide adequate time for your autogenous access to mature, so the ideal
time for access creation would be \textgreater{} 6 months for anticipated need of
dialysis. This allows for time for any subsequent interventions if your
access is not maturing.

\textbf{Should prosthetic access also be placed several months before
anticipated dialysis?}

Prosthetic access patency is limited by duration of access placement,
thus, if a patient requires prosthetic access, placement should be
delayed until about 3-6 weeks before initiation of
dialysis.\citep{nationalkidneyfoundation2015}

\textbf{For dialysis access creation, which site should be considered and used
first?}

Due to the easier accessibility and lower infection rates, upper
extremity access sites are used first. Furthermore, you want to place
your access as far distally in the extremity as possible to preserve the
proximal arm for future accesses.

\textbf{What are some important considerations in a patient's history when
planning a dialysis access?}

It is important to find out recent history of:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Previous access procedures
\item
  Peripheral IV lines
\item
  Sites of any existing or previous indwelling catheters including
  pacemakers and defibrillators
\item
  Trauma or surgery to the upper extremities
\end{itemize}

Moreover, you also want to consider the patient's quality of life, thus,
noting which extremity is dominant is important. If possible, you want
to create your dialysis access in the nondominant arm so that when the
patient is receiving dialysis multiple times a week, they are able to
use their dominant arm during their dialysis sessions.

However, placing a fistula with lowest rate of failure is preferred to
using non-dominant hand. Therefore, placement of access on the patients
dominant side would be preferred over placement of access with high risk
of failure (i.e.~on the side of an implantable cardiac
device).\citep{sgroi2019}

\textbf{As with any preoperative planning, physical examination is extremely
important. Central venous stenosis can cause problems such as prolonged
bleeding after dialysis sessions at the puncture site. What are some
signs of central venous stenosis?}

Unilateral arm swelling or edema and prominent venous collaterals are
signs of central venous stenosis. Central venous stenosis can lead to
venous hypertension which affects access patency and function, and also
causes disabling edema.

Beyond signs of central venous stenosis, when examining a patient, an
Allen's test should always be performed to evaluate palmer arch patency.

\textbf{Preoperative planning should also include arterial and venous
assessments. What are your size requirements for the artery and the vein
to be used in your dialysis access creation?}

First, you want equal pressure gradients in bilateral upper extremities.
If there is a pressure differential \textgreater20mmHg or pulses are non-palpable
then patients should undergo a duplex ultrasound to evaluate for
arterial insufficiency and and the artery should be greater than or
equal to 2mm. Segmental pressures have limited applicability. Patients
with correctable lesions on duplex may consider undergoing angiography
and intervention to optimize inflow.\citep{sidawy2008}

A venous duplex should also be done to evaluate for diameter,
distensibility and continuity. A vein mapping is useful to determine the
size of the patient's superficial veins at various points in the forearm
and upper arm. The vein should ideally be at least 3mm, but 2.5mm will
likely dilate after regional anesthesia and be sufficient for
access.\citep{huber2002, smith2012}

\textbf{Autogenous access should always be considered first due to higher
patency rates, lower infection rates, and longer duration of access
survival. What are the different configurations of autogenous
accesses?}

The first and best option would be direct arteriovenous anastomosis.
However, if that is not possible, then venous transposition should be
considered next follow by venous translocation.

Venous transposition is for deeper veins such as the basilic vein, which
is transposed so the vein lies just below the skin for easier access for
puncture during dialysis sessions. Transpositions are generally a
2-stage procedure in which the direct arteriovenous anastomosis is
created during the first stage and once the vein has arterialized 4-6
weeks later, the second stage of transposition is done when the vein is
easier to mobilize. Translocation procedures include harvesting the
femoral or saphenous vein and using it as a conduit for AV access
creation in the upper extremity.

\textbf{When can a venous transposition be done in a one stage procedure?}

When the vein is \textgreater4mm. When a patient has not been initiated on
dialysis and there is marginal vein that would require transposition,
but carry a significant risk of graft failure then a first-stage BB
fistula may be appropriate.

When comparing single- to two-stage brachiobasilic fistula, two-stage
creation had high rates of primary patency at 2-years. However, there
was no difference in infection rate, steal syndrome, hematoma,
pseudoaneurysm, stenosis, failure rate, primary or secondary patency at
1-year or secondary patency at 2-years.\citep{junyanwee2018}

\textbf{It was mentioned earlier that the dialysis access should be created as
distally as possible on the extremity. What are some of the most distal
locations?}

The snuffbox fistula, which is the posterior radial branch to cephalic
direct access and Brescia-Cimino-Appel (often shortened to just Cimino)
fistula which is the radial-cephalic wrist direct access are two of the
most distal fistulas that can be created. Overall, these have comparable
patency and ischemia risk. While snuff box fistulas carry a 10\% failure
rate at 1mo, the majority are able to be converted to RC
fistulas.\citep{siracuse2019}

\textbf{What are your arterial and venous options in the upper extremity?}

In the forearm, you have your radial, ulnar, and brachial arteries and
cephalic and basilic veins. In the upper arm, you have your brachial or
proximal radial arteries and cephalic, basilic, brachial and axillary
veins.

If adequate vein is available, most common access sites distal to
proximal include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Snuff box
\item
  Radiocephalic
\item
  Basilic transposition in forearm
\item
  Brachiocephalic fistula - these have a few advantages over more
  distal fistulas, including higher maturation rates, decreased time
  to maturity, higher patency and functional primary
  patency.\citep{nguyen2007}
\item
  Brachiobasilic fistula\citep{gilmore2006}
\item
  Vein transposition from a remote site - Femoral vein transposition
  can be used for upper extremity dialysis access in patients with
  previous upper extremity access complicated by infection, thus not a
  candidate for prosthetic, but no central stenosis. There is a high
  rate of hand ischemia due to larger conduit (up to 43\%).\citep{huber2004}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{If you need to use a prosthetic graft, what would you use?}

PTFE is the most common, they make tapered 4-7mm grafts to ensure the
size of your arterial anastomosis isn't too large to minimize chances of
steal. However, recent publications found that there is no difference
between tapered and non-tapered grafts in terms of primary patency,
steal syndrome, complication rates or need for
reintervention.\citep{roberts2019, han2017}

Overall AVG have benefit of earlier cannulation, discussed later,
however they have lower patency rates and higher infection rates. There
is no difference between grafts and fistulas for perioperative morbidity
and mortality.\citep{macsata2019}

\textbf{For patients with central venous stenosis or occlusion, what is
another alternative upper extremity access creation?}

Two overall strategies for managing patients with severe central venous
stenosis or occlusion are lower extremity AV access of hybrid
catheter/grafts. Patency of femoral vein transposition is better than
hybrid catheter/graft placement.\citep{brownie2016, glickman2011} We will
cover specifics of these techniques later.

For lower extremity AV access, femoral vein transposition has been shown
to have the best outcomes, followed by saphenous vein transposition and
graft placement. Lower extremity access should be avoided in patients
with peripheral vascular disease or lower extremity ischemic
symptoms--when in doubt perform duplex and segmental pressures to fully
evaluate. Veins should also be evaluated to ensure patency more
proximally.\citep{parekh2016}

For patients where lower extremity access may not be appropriate, the
hemodialysis reliable outflow (HeRO) device can come to the rescue.
These devices may not have been encountered in your training, so we will
go into detail here. This device is composed of 2 components: a graft
which is made of 6mm PTFE with a titanium coupler at one end, and a
venous outflow component of a 19 Fr silicone catheter reinforced with a
nitinol braid to prevent kinking. The graft portion is anastomosed to an
artery, usually brachial, and is tunneled subcutaneously and the venous
component is percutaneously placed into the right atrium via the IJ or
subclavian vein. The two components are connected with a titanium
coupler at the deltopectoral groove. If you need more immediate
dialysis, the super HeRO comes to the rescue in which the graft portion
is the early cannulation graft.

Hybrid catheter/grafts are good alternatives in patients with previous
line infections, central stenosis, peripheral vascular disease and no
suitable vein in the upper extremities. They have shown fewer bacteremia
episodes than catheter, low primary patency rate and acceptable
secondary patency rates.\citep{alshakarchi2015} Absolute contraindications
include donor artery \textless3mm, inability to dilate outflow vein to 19f,
allergy to device materials (ePTFE, silicone, titanium, nitinol), and
current active infection.\citep{meritmedical}

\hypertarget{techniques-for-access-creation}{%
\section{Techniques for access creation}\label{techniques-for-access-creation}}

\textbf{The techniques of arteriovenous fistula creation are common across
access sites. Can you go through the techniques?}

First the vein is identified and the distal end is transected and
flushed with heparin. By flushing with the heparin, you are able to
access the caliber and extent of the vein as well as identify any side
branches

Then after distal and proximal control of your artery, a 4-6mm
arteriotomy is made. The length is limited to decrease incidence of
arterial steal. The artery is then flushed with heparin to avoid
thrombosis during the anastomosis and an anastomosis is created between
the side of the artery and the end of the vein. A 6-0 or 7-0
nonabsorbable continuous suture should be used to create the anastomosis
to avoid future dilation of the anastomosis.

\textbf{What are some other options if an access is not able to be created in
the upper extremity?}

Autogenous accesses can also be created in the lower extremity. Femoral
artery to femoral vein or saphenous vein anastomosis can be created.
Both veins have to be transposed. Synthetic grafts have high infection
rates (as high as 22\% in some series) and only a 50\% patency at 6
months.\citep{antoniou2009, lazarides2018, pike2019} Risk of lower
extremity ischemia increased with burden of PVD, AV fistula vs graft,
distal arterial inflow, and large femoral vein mismatch, but can be
tempered by banding/narrowing of femoral vein at the time of
surgery.\citep{antoniou2009, bourquelot2012, gradman2005}

Access creation in the chest wall or cervical region is also possible
with axillary artery to ipsilateral axillary vein loop access, axillary
artery to contralateral axillary or jugular vein straight access (ie
necklace access) and brachial artery to jugular vein straight access.
Keep in mind that for these fistulas, the central veins must be patent.

\textbf{Are there benefits to different anesthetic techniques used during
access placement, such as regional anesthesia?}

Regional anesthesia for AVF creation has been associated with higher
perioerative flow and lower rates of vasospasm resulting in higher rates
of short term patency. Regional anesthesia has not been associated with
perioperative rates of major morbidity or mortality.\citep{aitken2016, siracuse2014}

\textbf{What is the role for endovascular creation of AV fistula?}

New methods are now available to perform an upper extremity AVF
endovascularly, although many patients would be suitable candidates, as
of now the usability of these fistulas have not matched that of
surgically placed AVF.\citep{lok2017}

\textbf{When is the newly created dialysis access ready for use?}

A good way to remember this is the rule of 6's. it's ready to use when
the Fistula is 6mm in Diameter, has a flow of 600ml/min, is 6mm from the
surface of the skin and usually takes 6 weeks to mature.

Prosthetic AV accesses can be used as early as 2 weeks postoperatively.
If you use the 3-layer early cannulation grafts, the access can be used
as early as 24 hours after access creation. This is great because it
offers the potential for avoidance of dialysis catheters in patients who
need dialysis immediately.\citep{glickman2015}

\hypertarget{maintenance-and-complications}{%
\section{Maintenance and complications}\label{maintenance-and-complications}}

\hypertarget{failure-to-mature}{%
\subsection{Failure to mature}\label{failure-to-mature}}

\textbf{What are some reasons why an access may fail to mature?}

Sometimes your access may have arterial inflow stenosis. This is
difficult to detect clinically because there will be a palpable thrill,
however, due to the stenosis, the flow is not sufficient enough for
dialysis. In the absence of arterial inflow issues, collateral or large
venous branches can divert blood away from the main access channel
resulting in insufficient flow.

\textbf{If the newly created AV fistula is not maturing, what are some
secondary procedures to help with maturation?}

Open procedures include vein patches, interposition vein grafts, vein
transposition to proximal arteries, branch ligations, and vein
superficialization. Endovascular procedures include arterial and venous
angioplasties to improve inflow or outflow issues.\citep{sidawy2008}

\hypertarget{access-failure}{%
\subsection{Access Failure}\label{access-failure}}

\textbf{Once a dialysis access is created, maintenance of the access is
extremely important. The flow disturbances and hemodynamic changes
associated with AV access creation causes intimal hyperplasia leading to
venous outflow stenosis. This can ultimately lead to access thrombosis
and failure. What are some methods of detecting access failure?}

One way of detecting a well functioning access is a strong thrill at the
arterial anastomosis which continues a few centimeters into the outflow
vein. If you feel a pulsation near the venous outflow, then a stenosis
or thrombosis is likely. If you feel a thrill distal to the area of
pulsation, then you have likely localized your area of stenosis. It is
important to note that you may feel a pulsation at a pseudoaneurysm
independent of venous outflow issues.

Other signs of outflow stenosis are collateral veins or upper extremity
edema.\citep{padberg2008} This is indicative of venous hypertension likely
secondary to stenosis. You will typically see this in the shoulder area
or anterior chest as a results of subclavian vein stenosis/thrombosis.
Moreover, these high venous pressures as a result of the stenosis can
result in excessive and prolonged bleeding after removal of needles from
the dialysis puncture sites. This is often the first sign of elevated
venous pressures. These patients should undergo a fistulogram to
evaluate for underlying outflow stenosis.\citep{caromonroig2018}

The most common cause of graft failure in upper extremity fistulas is
venous outflow stenosis and in grafts is venous anastomotic intimal
hyperplasia.\citep{berman2001, padberg2008} Diagnostic fistulogram is a very
useful tool to diagnose and treat potential access complications.
Diagnostic fistulogram is often performed with proximal access of the
fistula a few centimeters distal to the anastomosis. Compression of
venous outflow is necessary to evaluate for inflow and anastomotic
issues.\citep{bountouris2018}

Finally, even patients with normal physical exam can have issues while
on the hemodialysis circuit, such as recirculation. When in doubt, if
there are recurrent issues with hemodialysis, the patient should undergo
a fistulogram to evaluate for occult venous outflow stenosis that may be
missed on other diagnostic modalities.\citep{sidawy2008}

\textbf{What are some endovascular interventions for a failing access?}

First line therapy for outflow stenosis is a simple balloon angioplasty
of the stenosed area.\citep{berman2001} Insufflation times are generally up
to 2-3 minutes. Treatment of stenosis 2/2 intimal hyperplasia often
require high pressures of 20 ATM or more. However, this is a double edge
sword because this can lead to trauma in the veins stimulating a further
intimal hyperplasia process. Some advocate a cutting balloon before high
pressure dilation. Stenting is also an option to treat residual stenosis
or dissections after balloon angioplasty. Covered stents have shown good
patency results.

Some unique situations include, recurrent cephalic arch stenosis which
may be best treated with bare metal stenting.\citep{shemesh2008} Proximal
occlusions (i.e.~subclavian) may be best treated primarily with a
covered stent.\citep{agarwal2015, anaya-ayala2011}

\textbf{If endovascular interventions fail, what are some open options for
managing a failing access?}

Generally an interposition graft or patch angioplasty is performed and
the results of the two techniques are largely equivalent.

\textbf{If an AV access has ultimately failed and thrombosed, what are your
endovascular options at this point?}

Some endovascular options are catheter directed thrombolysis with about
2-4mg of tPA injected into the clot, followed by balloon angioplasty
(typically an 8mm by 8cm high pressure balloon). A mechanical
thrombectomy device, such as angiojet, can also be used in combination
to thrombolysis.

Alternatively, an open thrombectomy with a thromboembolectomy balloon
and patch angioplasty of venous stenosis areas can also be used.
Moreover, a hybrid approach of open thrombectomy with percutaneous
interventions of venous stenosis areas has been described.

Immediate postoperative thrombosis of an AV graft is likely technical -
inadequate inflow (i.e.~small brachial artery) or outflow
stenosis/occlusion. Open revision and thrombectomy is often the best
option.\citep{paulson2002}

\textbf{What are some ways to manage failing AV access in the setting of
ipsilateral vTOS?}

Performing a first rib resection in a hemodialysis patient is high risk
and controversial. However, if there is a prominent external jugular
vein, then there are reports of external to internal jugular vein
transposition offering more in line drainage and access
salvage.\citep{degiovanni2020}

\hypertarget{sec-steal-syndrome}{%
\subsection{Steal Syndrome}\label{sec-steal-syndrome}}

\textbf{Earlier, you mentioned steal syndrome, can you explain to us what this
is?}

Steal syndrome is also known as Access Related Hand Ischemis = ARHI. It
is an uncommon but devastating complication of access creation. All
patients with arteriovenous fistulas have some degree of physiologic
steal or reversal of flow in part of the artery distal to the fistula.
However, this is not sufficient enough to cause ischemia. Rather,
ischemia results from inadequate collateral circulation and inability of
peripheral arteries to meet the increased demand. Diseased vessels do
not dilate and stenosis of arteries leads to decreased distal perfusion
pressure. Furthermore, hypotension during dialysis further decreases
perfusion causing symptoms. Steal can be limb threatening and is graded
as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Grade 0 - asymptomatic, no flow augmentation or steal
\item
  Grade 1 - asymptomatic, mild ischemia with signs of cool extremity
  and flow augmentation with access occlusion (May be seen in over
  half of AV access patients)\citep{leake2015}
\item
  Grade 2 - moderate/intermittent ischemia that is experienced only
  during dialysis and patients feel claudication.
\item
  Grade 3 - severe, ischemic pain at rest with tissue loss.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are some symptoms and signs of Steal syndrome?}

Symptoms include coolness, parasthesias, rest pain, and weakness. Signs
of steal include cool to touch, pallor, cyanosis, delayed capillary
refill, absent pulses/signals, diminished sensation, weak grip, and in
severe cases ulceration or gangrene. If the patient shows improvement
with access compression, diagnosis is confirmed.

Patients with acute pain and loss of pulses after AVF creation should
first have arterial injury/thrombosis ruled out, but then after
diagnosis of steal syndrome should undergo fistula
ligation.\citep{schanzer2004, yevzlin2016}

\textbf{When is an intervention necessary to treat steal syndrome?}

You do not need to intervene for grade 0 and 1.\citep{leake2015} For grade 3
an intervention is mandatory. The goal of treatment includes symptom
resolution and access preservation, and this is achieved by reducing
access flow and increasing distal arterial flow.

The most important finding on duplex ultrasound to evaluate for steal
syndrome is fistula flow rate. High flow rates suggest a primary problem
with the fistula, low or normal flow suggests underlying PVD and inflow
insufficiency as etiology.\citep{alshakarchi2016, leake2015} Approximately
5\% of steal is secondary to inflow stenosis.

\textbf{What are your intervention options for resolving steal syndrome?}

There are multiple ways to manage steal syndrome, detailed as
follows:\citep{leake2015, gupta2011}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  AV Fistula Banding is a simple option to reduce access flow. This is
  done by suture plication, placement of single narrowing tie or wrap
  by constrictive cuff to cause a stenosis in the AV access near the
  arterial anastomosis. A minimally invasive approach is used by the
  MILLER banding which uses an endoluminal 4 or 5mm balloon as a sizer
  and a suture is placed around the access with the balloon inflated.
  This procedure increases arterial inflow towards the hand. Flow
  should be maintained at 600ml/min.
\item
  Revision using distal inflow (RUDI) involves ligation of the fistula
  at the arterial anastomosis and reestablishment of flow via a more
  distal artery by bypass or vein translocation. This allows for
  decreased flow through the access by reducing the fistula diameter
  and by taking inflow form a smaller vessel. However, ultimately, the
  fistula is placed at risk
\item
  Proximalizaiton of arterial inflow (PAI) involves ligation of AV
  anastomosis, and the inflow is moved to a more proximal level with a
  prosthetic interposition. Dialysis can be continue via the vein. The
  main advantage is the native artery's continuity.\citep{zanow2006}
\item
  Distal revascularization-interval ligation (DRIL) is ultimately
  considered the best option by many vascular surgeons due to the
  excellent results shown. There is an arterial bypass created
  originating proximal to the access and ending distal to the access,
  with ligation of the artery distal to the anastomosis. This prevents
  retrograde flow from distal vessels and allows for a low resistance
  pathway for arterial supply to the hand. DRIL may be particularly
  useful in patients with distal brachial, proximal ulnar/radial
  disease, as this can bypass the underlying stenosis as
  well.\citep{leake2015}
\item
  Distal radial artery ligation (DRAL) can be performed for palmar
  arch steal syndrome from radio-cephalic av accesses, to prevent
  reversal of flow in the palmar arch. However, the ulnar artery
  patency needs to evaluated first.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{neuropathy-and-neuropraxia}{%
\subsection{Neuropathy and Neuropraxia}\label{neuropathy-and-neuropraxia}}

\textbf{What complication often presents like steal syndrome, but with easily
palpable distal pulses?}

Access creation can result in neuropathy. It is important to note that
over 2/3s of the patients have preexisting peripheral neuropathy.
Neuropathy is also graded:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Grade 0 - asymptomatic
\item
  Grade 1 - mild intermittent changes (pain, paresthesia, numbness
  with sensory deficit)
\item
  Grade 2 - moderate persistent sensory changes
\item
  Grade 3 - severe sensory changes with progressive motor loss
  (motion, strength, muscle wasting).
\end{itemize}

Ischemic monomelic neuropathy is rare but occurs acutely after AV access
creation. Within hours of surgery, patients develop acute pain,
weakness, or paralysis of hand and forearm muscles with prominent
sensory loss. However, the hand is warm with palpable pulse or audible
signal in distal radial and ulnar arteries. It is important to note that
pain out of proportion is what differentiates IMN from ARHI. Treatment
is access ligation or emergent augmentation of flow.

\hypertarget{perioperative-neuropraxia}{%
\subsection{Perioperative neuropraxia}\label{perioperative-neuropraxia}}

\textbf{What are some common technical complications after placement of AV
access?}

Post operative numbness of the thumb, index and middle finger and
weakness of abduction and grip strength may suggest median nerve
neuropraxia and will likely resolve. However, you need to rule out steal
syndrome.\citep{talebi2011, vahdatpour2012}

Postoperative hematoma can often just be observed. However, signs of
median nerve compression mandate immediate operative brachial sheath
evacuation or the neurologic deficits may become
permanent.\citep{padberg2008}

Prosthetic grafts can results in seroma from ultrafiltration of the
graft and most resolve without intervention.

\hypertarget{bleeding-and-aneurysm}{%
\subsection{Bleeding and Aneurysm}\label{bleeding-and-aneurysm}}

\textbf{What presentations require urgent revision?}

Fistulas that present with bleeding from a visible ulcer, wet scabbing,
frank infection or acute pseudoaneurysm often require urgent open
revision. Some access may be salvaged, but in acute presentations with
significant risk of life threatening hemorrhage the safest option may be
to ligate the access and place a temporary dialysis access
line.\citep{galbusera2009}

\textbf{Many fistulas develop aneurysms over time. When do fistula aneurysms
require revision?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Pseudoaneurysms often result from trauma due to repeated punctures
  or poor technique
\item
  True aneurysms result from long standing hemodynamically significant
  outflow stenosis.
\end{itemize}

Both can lead to cannulation difficulties, increased risk of thrombosis,
pain, bleeding and cosmetic deformities. AV aneurysms should be revised
if they develop skin thinning, ulceration or bleeding. Early skin
changes can be observed. Intervention often requires revision with open
plication/excision or ligation. When isolated to a short segment,
attempts should be made to salvage the fistula.\citep{al-jaishi2017, al-thani2017, pasklinsky2011}

\hypertarget{dialysis-catheters}{%
\section{Dialysis Catheters}\label{dialysis-catheters}}

\textbf{While ideally every patient would have surgically placed access, many
patients still receive dialysis through catheters. What is the
difference between an acute and chronic hemodialysis catheter?}

Chronic catheters have a subcutaneous cuff at the exit site and tunneled
to the vein. This decreases infection rates and makes them less likely
to become dislodged. Tunneled hemodialysis catheters can be used up to
12 months.

\textbf{If catheters cause so much problems such as infection and central
venous stenosis, what would be an indication for them?}

The most common indication would be for urgent hemodialysis. But other
indications include patient who are not operative candidates due to
advanced comorbidities, or patients who are unable to have an AVF or AVG
due to anatomic feasibility. Temporary dialysis access may also be
needed in patients who have just had a peritoneal dialysis catheter
placement or in chronic peritoneal dialysis catheter patients requiring
abdominal or inguinal surgery.

\textbf{Which site is the most ideal site for a hemodialysis catheter?}

The right internal jugular vein is preferred because it has the best
patency.

If all traditional access sites are inaccessible, translumbar IVC
catheters may be used as a last resort as salvage. Overall complications
are similar to other permanent dialysis access sites, however obesity is
a relative contraindication due to potential migration into the soft
tissues.

\textbf{Every procedure has potential complications. What are the immediate
complications of catheter placement?}

When placed in the internal jugular veins, there is always a chance of a
pneumothorax or hemothorax. Wire embolism can occur is control of the
wire is lost during the procedure. If the guidewire is placed too far,
then there is always a chance of arrhythmia. Thus, the best place for
the wire is through the IVC. With a left internal jugular vein approach,
there is always a risk of thoracic duct laceration. If a leak is
apparent, then the catheter needs to be removed immediately and a
pressure dressing applied.

\textbf{How do you manage infected hemodialysis lines?}

Infected hemodialysis lines should be removed. Ideally you should avoid
replacing any lines until blood cultures have been negative for 48hrs,
particularly subsequent permanent
lines\citep{vascularaccess2006workgroup2006}

\hypertarget{peritoneal-dialysis}{%
\section{Peritoneal Dialysis}\label{peritoneal-dialysis}}

\textbf{Although not often managed by the vascular surgeon, we should still be
aware of another method of dialysis in renal failure patients. What are
the indications for peritoneal dialysis?}

Peritoneal dialysis is better tolerated and less disruptive to daily
life, so is often a better option for young, active patients with less
comorbidities. PD can be considered first-line or in patients who are
not candidates for HD, but require high patient engagement and education
and so may not be appropriate for patients with other chronic diseases
limiting independence, unstable housing, cognitive decline or poor
management other medical issues.\citep{ansari2011}

From a technical standpoint, PD may be difficult in patients who have
had multiple previous open abdominal surgeries, but can be tolerated in
patients who have had minimally invasive or minor abdominal
procedures.\citep{sinnakirouchenan2011} Long dwell times with glucose
solution can sometimes lead to hyperglycemia. The major reason for
conversion from PD to HD is PD catheter infection.\citep{li2017}

\textbf{UNDER CONSTRUCTION - This Chapter is Currently in DRAFT mode}

\textbf{06 Jan 2022}: \emph{Alaska Pendleton, MD and Aahita Dua, MD}

\emph{Acknowledgements: A special thanks to Drena Root, Technical Director at
the Massachusetts General Hospital Vascular Center, without whom this
imaging would not have been possible.}

So let's start with an overview of ultrasound modalities, waveforms, and
changes proximal and distal to flow-limiting stenosis:

\hypertarget{overview}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Overview}}{Overview}}\label{overview}}

\textbf{Brief overview of ultrasound:} Ultrasonography uses \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_wave}{sound
waves} with
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency}{frequencies} higher than those
audible to humans. Ultrasound images are created by sending pulses of
ultrasound into \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)}{tissue}
using a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound_transducer\#Use_in_medicine}{probe}.
Reflected pulses are recorded and displayed as an image. There are many
types of ultrasound images, but two modes commonly seen in vascular
ultrasonography are B-mode and doppler:

\textbf{B-mode (Brightness) imaging}~is a 2-D, black and white display of
tissue~\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_impedance}{acoustic
impedance}s.

\textbf{Doppler mode}~uses the Doppler effect to measure and visualize blood
flow.

\textbf{Spectral Doppler} converts frequency shifts from moving blood to
velocities using the Doppler equation, and displays a ``spectrum'' of
these frequencies as Doppler waveforms.

\textbf{Color Doppler} presents velocity information as a color-coded overlay
on top of a B-mode image. Duplex ultrasonography is a term commonly used
for the simultaneous presentation of B-mode and doppler data.

\textbf{Power Doppler} is less frequently use, but is based solely on
amplitude of the doppler signal without giving information on direction.
This is particularly useful to detect certain low or abnormal flow
states, such as testicular/ovarian torsion, carotid string sign, slow
intrarenal flow, supporting occlusion seen on B-mode or
color.\citep{pellerito2019}

\hypertarget{waveforms}{%
\subsection{Waveforms}\label{waveforms}}

\textbf{What do normal spectral waveforms look like?}

\uline{Normal spectral waveforms} have a brisk upstroke, sharp
peak, rapid downstroke. A ``spectral window'' under the waveform, that is
that black space between the spectral waveform and the 0 velocity axis,
represents the absence of lower velocities-indicative of laminar flow
within the vessel (Image 1: normal spectrum waveform)

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide2}

\textbf{How can we differentiate low vs high resistance waveforms?}

Waveform profiles change depending upon the nature of the distal
vascular bed being supplied. Organs like the brain, kidneys, liver,
spleen, peripheral muscle during exercise, and postprandial SMA have
constant high metabolic demand, and are therefore low resistance
vascular beds. \uline{Low resistance waveforms} for arteries
supplying these organs demonstrate constant forward flow throughout the
cardiac cycle because the distal bed being supplied has low resistance
leading to high end-diastolic flow.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide3}

In contrast, \uline{high resistance waveforms} are seen for
arteries supplying resting peripheral muscles, fasted mesenteric beds
(such as the fasting SMA), and the external carotid artery. High
resistance waveforms are characterized by triphasic morphology, with a
sharp peak, early diastolic flow reversal, brief forward flow (elastic
recoil of the artery, and then no flow during the remainder of the
diastolic phase.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide4}

\textbf{How does flow-limiting stenosis change the waveform?}

First let's define \uline{Stenosis:}~A hemodynamically significant
stenosis (area reduction \textgreater50\%) will result in a doubling of velocity
from the inflow segment to the area of maximal stenosis (velocity ratio
\textgreater{} 2).

\textbf{Now what do waveforms look like AFTER a flow-limiting stenosis?}

\uline{Tardus et parvus} refers to a pattern of Doppler ultrasound
spectral waveform resulting from arterial stenosis. The tardus et parvus
waveform is delayed with prolonged systolic acceleration (tardus) and
diminished with a small systolic amplitude and rounded systolic peak
(parvus). This phenomenon is observed downstream from the site of
stenosis. Tardus parvus in the CFA represents upstream (iliac) stenosis.
Tardus parvus in the brachial artery likely represents upstream
(subclavian or axillary) stenosis.\citep{hwang2017, pellerito2019}

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide5}

\textbf{So what will the waveform look like BEFORE a flow-limiting stenosis?}

\uline{Distal stenosis:} Distal occlusive disease will result in a
high resistance waveform, with absent diastolic flow. (Image 5: Distal
stenosis with absent diastolic flow)

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide6}

Now that we've covered the basics, let's move through by organ-~system
high-yield vascular lab studies, findings, and pathologies.We'll start
with the extracranial evaluation, a highly-tested area of vascular
ultrasonography.

\textbf{Are there any considerations we need to understand when assessing a
stented vessel with ultrasound?}

Stenting decreases vessel compliance and increases observed velocities.
There is no defined consensus, but \uline{in-stent restenosis} is
classified by some as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textgreater50\%

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    SFA - Vr \textgreater1.5 or PSV \textgreater200 \citep{baril2009, kawarada2013}
  \item
    ICA - ICA/CCA \textgreater2.7 and PSV \textgreater220.\citep{lal2008}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textgreater80\%

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    SFA - Vr \textgreater{} 3.5 or PSV \textgreater275 \citep{baril2009, kawarada2013}
  \item
    ICA - ICA/CCA \textgreater{} 4.15 and PSV \textgreater{} 340.\citep{lal2008}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

It should be noted that restenosis of stents vs vein grafts in the lower
extremity will have higher velocity for the same percentage of stenosis.
Tardus et parvus waveforms distal to a stent should raise concern that
stenosis is hemodynamically significant.\citep{baril2009, kawarada2013}

\textbf{Ultrasound compared to other diagnostic modalities}

Duplex is often adequate to visualize any peripheral arterial bed, even
the aorta and iliacs.\citep{muelaméndez2018}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CT - limitations include ionizing radiation, iodinated contrast and
  not appropriate in patients with CKD.
\item
  MRA - performed with gadolinium-based contrast and not appropriate
  in patients with ESRD.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{extracranial}{%
\section{Extracranial}\label{extracranial}}

\textbf{What does a typical extracranial evaluation involve?}

Examine CCA (2 views), ICA (2 views), ECA, vertebral arteries

\textbf{What are normal ICA and ECA waveforms?}

\uline{Normal ECA vs ICA waveform:} The external carotid artery
waveform reflects a high resistance vascular bed. This means minimal
diastolic flow. Conversely, the ICA waveform reflects a low resistance
vascular bed with antegrade diastolic flow.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide7}

This makes sense, as the ICA is supplying the brain while the ECA is
supplying the face. Intuitively, the common carotid artery~ is a mixture
of the ICA and ECA waveform morphologies. Like the ICA with forward flow
throughout diastole, but less as compared to the ICA due to the high
resistance influence of the ECA.

Another way of differentiating the external and internal carotid
arteries is the ``temporal tap''. Tapping on the superficial temporal
artery (a branch of the ECA) will be transmitted as small pulsations in
the diastolic component of the external carotid artery.\citep{pellerito2019, size2013}

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide8}

\textbf{Can you talk about diagnostic criteria for ICA stenosis?}

\uline{Parameters for ICA stenosis}: These are a few numbers that
are (unfortunately) essential to memorize for the VSITE and RPVI.

Although criteria differ between guidelines, the Carotid Consensus
Criteria, define ICA stenosis \textgreater= 70\% as a peak systolic velocity \textgreater=
230 cm/sec, EDV \textgreater{} 100 cm/sec, and ICA/CCA ratio \textgreater{} 4.0. Of note,
post-stenting criteria vary from pre-stenting criteria. Stenosis
criteria are not clearly defined for the CCA or ECA.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide9}

\textbf{When is surgery indicated for ICA stenosis?}

\uline{Parameters for when surgery indicated:}

Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) \textgreater60\% stenosis
asymptomatic, NASCET \textgreater50\% stenosis symptomatic

For more see \ref{cerebrovascular}.

\textbf{Let's talk about other pathologies that can be visualized on
extracranial ultrasound:}

\uline{Pathologies:} Stenosis (plaque), dissection (flap),
aneurysms (rare), occlusion (no flow, do not operate), carotid body
tumor (splaying of ECA/ICA, fed by ECA branches), FMD.

FMD is frequently encountered on the VSITE/RPVI. How would this appear
on the exams?

\uline{Fibromuscular dysplasia}~of the internal carotid arteries
affects women more commonly than men. Duplex findings show a ``chain of
lakes'' appearance, demonstrative of multiple septa and small aneurysms.
Velocity elevations and increased turbulence in the waveform patterns is
typically found on Doppler interrogation.\citep{olin2012}

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide10}

\uline{Aortic stenosis:} Tardus parvus waveforms in both common
carotid arteries can be a sign of more proximal disease of the aortic
valve or global myocardial dysfunction.

\textbf{How to treat?}

Aspirin if asymptomatic, POBA if symptomatic.

\textbf{Are there other frequently tested pathologies demonstrated on
extracranial exam?}

\uline{Subclavian steal:}~Subclavian steal occurs when a proximal
subclavian stenosis or occlusion leads to reversal of vertebral artery
flow. This causes ``stealing'' of blood from the posterior cerebral
circulation, and presents as vertebrobasilar insufficiency.

\textbf{How does this look on duplex?}

Normal vertebral flow looks very similar to ICA: antegrade low
resistance waveforms with constant forward flow throughout the cardiac
cycle. As subclavian stenosis progresses, one can see mid-systolic
velocity deceleration ('bunny ears'') , with mild stenosis bidirectional
flow can signify ``pre-steal'' phenomena, and with severe steal, there is
a complete reversal of flow in the vertebral artery towards the arm
rather than towards the brain.\citep{kalaria2005, mousa2017}

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide11}

\uline{Innominate stenosis:}~A phenomenon that is related to this,
is innominate stenosis. Here again the patient will present with
vertebrobasilar insufficiency, indicative of diminished vertebral
antegrade flow, but additionally will experience right hemispheric
insufficiency secondary to diminished R ICA antegrade flow. The
right-side duplex will demonstrate flow reversal in the vertebral
artery, abnormal waveforms in the subclavian, as well as steal pattern
waveforms in the common and internal carotid arteries. The common
denominator for all of these findings is significant disease in the
innominate artery.

\textbf{What other extracranial arteries of the head and neck can be evaluated
separately?}

\uline{Temporal arteritis} - well visualized with high frequency
transducer (10 MHz or greater). Pathognomonic halo effect of
anechoic/hypoechoic edemetous tissue surrounding the lumen due to
concentric inflammation.\citep{ball2010, schmidt2014}

\hypertarget{intracranial}{%
\section{Intracranial}\label{intracranial}}

So that covers extracranial vascular lab evaluation. What about
intracranial?

This is less frequently tested, so we will discuss just a brief overview
of views and some of the more commonly tested pathologies related to
transcranial doppler (TCD).

\uline{\textbf{Intracranial:}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Three primary views: temporal, foraminal (occipital), orbital views

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Temporal view:}~Used to interrogate PCA, ACA, MCA, and ICA.
    The~MCA, ICA and PCA flow direction is towards the probe, the~,
    The ACA~flow direction~is AWAY.
  \item
    \textbf{Occipital view:}~Basilar and vertebral arteries (both away).
  \item
    \textbf{Orbital view:}~Ophthalmic and ICA
  \item
    Arteries differentiated by depth. MCA 3-6 cm, everything else
    deeper.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are some frequently tested pathologies that are identified on
TCD?}

Indications often tested:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \uline{MCA spasm (severe PSV\textgreater200)}: Can be seen in sickle
  cell disease with studies indicating a strong correlation between
  mean velocities of \textgreater200cm/s and the rate of stroke in children with
  sickle cell disease. With blood transfusions, stroke risk can be
  reduced from \textgreater10\% to \textless1\% per year.
  \citep{bulasTranscranialDopplerTCD2000}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Lindegrad ratio is the MCA velocity divided by the distal ICA
    velocity and can also be used to assess MCA spasm.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Ratio of 3-6 is indicative of mild-mod vasospasm.
    \item
      \textgreater6 is severe vasospasm.
    \item
      \textless3 is a sign of hyperemia.\citep{kirsch2013}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \uline{Cerebral ischemia during CEA:} Comparing transcranial
  Doppler sonography, near-infrared spectroscopy, stump pressure
  measurement, and somatosensory evoked potentials, cerebral ischemia
  was most accurately predicted by the percent change in transcranial
  Doppler detected middle cerebral artery velocity. Detection of a
  greater than 50\% drop in middle cerebral artery velocity using
  transcranial Doppler is 100\% sensitive for detecting cerebral
  ischemia.\citep{moritzAccuracyCerebralMonitoring2007}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TCD can also demonstrate microemboli (high spikes of white
    vertical lines on spectral doppler) during CEA.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A shower of bubbles in both cerebral hemispheres upon injection with
  agitated saline is consistent with a R to L cardiac shunt and patent
  foramen ovale.\citep{zito2009}
\item
  Elevated contralateral ICA velocities can demonstrate compensatory
  flow and collateralizaiton and can be a sign of persistent MCA
  occlusion.
\item
  Mechanical Compression of the vertebral arteries: TCD will show
  normal posterior circulation velocities at rest, disappearance of
  waveform on provocative maneuvers, and increase in velocity once
  back in a neutral position representing a reactive
  hyperemia.\citep{vilela2005}
\item
  Vasomotor activity can be evaluated as well with TCD. Hypercapnia or
  breath-hodling should result in vasodilation and increased flow.
  Hypocapnia in decreased flow. No change in response to hyper or
  hypocapnia can show poor cerebral autoregulation.\citep{müller1995}
\item
  Reversal of flow in the ophthalmic artery can be a sign of
  ipsilateral ICA occlusion.\citep{guan2013}
\item
  Brain death determination - In patients with cerebral arrest (brain
  death) TCD will demonstrate a low amplitude, high resistance
  waveform with to and fro flow with a zero net flow.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{upper-extremity}{%
\section{Upper Extremity}\label{upper-extremity}}

Having covered head and neck vasculature, let's move on to peripheral
vasculature. This is a huge area both on the VSITE/RPVI and in practice.
In this section we'll cover first the upper, then the lower extremity
vasculature.

\textbf{So first, what are characteristics of waveforms in the peripheral
vasculature?}

\uline{Peripheral}: Normal waveforms are indicative of high
resistance distal beds, so we would expect triphasic waveforms

\textbf{What are normal arterial parameters in the upper extremities?}

Normal pressure gradient between the right and left brachial pressures
is \textless20 mmHg. Normal finger pressure is \textgreater80\% of the ipsilateral
brachial systolic pressure. Digital brachial index \textless0.8 is abnormal and
\textless0.5 is diagnostic of ischemia. Absolute digital pressure \textless70mmHg is
abnomal and \textless60mmHg is diagnostic for ischemia. A gradient between
digits of \textgreater15 mmHg is considered abnormal. These criteria are used in
occlusive disease and steal syndrome.\citep{chloros2008, sen2016}

\textbf{Let's talk about some of the most frequently tested pathologies,
starting with arterial TOS.}

\uline{Arterial TOS:}~Results from compression of the subclavian
artery at the level of the first rib within the scalene triangle.
Arterial TOS testing is done by placing a sensor, most often
photoplethysmography (PPG), on one finger of each hand, recording the
resting waveforms and then recording while during maneuvers to evoke
arterial compression in the thoracic outlet.\citep{size2013}

\textbf{Can you tell us a little more about PPG testing?}

\uline{Photoplethysmography (PPG)}~uses an infrared light to
illuminate superficial tissue. The reflection is received by a
photosensor, and amplitude of the reflected light is proportional to the
volume of red blood cells in the sample area. A normal digital arterial
PPG has a brisk upstroke with a narrow systolic peak, and a dicrotic
notch on the downslope during diastole.\citep{carter2001}

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide12}

Digital PPGs change with progression of peripheral vascular disease. The
first changes are a loss of amplitude and loss of the dicrotic notch.
More advanced disease~findings include a flattened systolic peak and a
prolonged upstroke. Significant arterial TOS is suggested when there is
a loss or persistent flattening of the digit waveforms during any of the
positional changes that can compress the subclavian artery (either with
the clavicle, first rib and scalene muscle). However, it should be noted
that up to one-third of patients without arterial TOS may have some
degree of subclavian artery compression with positional maneuvers.

\textbf{What are other diseases affecting the upper extremity?}

\uline{Raynaud's:}~Vasospastic disorder characterized by temporary
vasospasm. Diagnosis may be assisted by decrease in digital waveforms
with immersion of the hand in cold water.

\uline{Thromboangiitis obliterans:}~Is a segmental
non-atherosclerotic inflammatory disorder characterized by
microthrombosis that primarily involves the small- and medium-sized
arteries. Ultrasonography may demonstrate the classical ``corkscrew''
collateral development at the level of occlusion. TA has a male
predominance and first line treatment is smoking cessation.

\hypertarget{hemodialysis-access}{%
\subsection{Hemodialysis Access}\label{hemodialysis-access}}

Before we segue to the lower extremities, this is a good time to discuss
an entity frequently tested on the VSITE, and that constitutes for many
vascular surgeons a notable portion of their practice, and that is
hemodialysis access, and specifically fistulas.

\uline{Fistulas}: Ultrasound is one of the key modalities used in
identifying suitable anatomy for fistula placement, suitability of a
fistula for dialysis, and finally complications of fistulas.

\textbf{So first, assessment for fistula placement:}

The optimal configuration for an AVF is determined on the basis of vein
mapping and noninvasive studies. Veins should measure \textgreater3 mm in diameter
(\textgreater2.5 mm may be acceptable, as veins are likely to dilate under
anesthesia), and there should be no arterial inflow stenosis or venous
outflow stenosis. Duplex ultrasound arterial imaging can be performed at
the same time as vein mapping and can provide important predictors of
fistula maturation, such as arterial diameter and flow. The minimal
arterial lumen diameter is 2 mm.

\textbf{How can we tell if a fistula is ready to be used for hemodialysis
access?}

Rule of 6's: At six weeks post-creation the diameter of the fistula
should be at least 6 mm and the depth no more than 0.6 cm. The flow rate
should be at least 600mL/min, and the length of the fistula should be 6
cm to allow for a successful two-needle dialysis.

Brachial artery volume flow rate (VFR) is one of the best measurements
to identify poor fistula maturation. \textgreater800 ml/min is ideal, but \textgreater600 is
often sufficient.\citep{ko2015}

\textbf{What do normal fistula spectral waveforms look like?}

\uline{Waveform:}~The arterial waveform should demonstrate very
low resistance throughout diastole. End diastolic velocity should be one
half to two thirds of peak systolic velocity in a well-functioning
fistula. As a side note, this is also what one would see in an
iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula, as between the femoral artery and
vein.\citep{teodorescu2012}

\textbf{Let's discuss commonly encountered complications and pathologies
identified in association with fistulas:}

\uline{Pseudoaneurysms:}~Pseudoaneurysms commonly occur when a
puncture fails to seal and the blood is contained by the surrounding
soft tissue. As in other locations, pseudoaneurysms are defined on
imaging by a communicating neck between the arterial vessel and
pseudoaneurysmal sac with ``to-and-fro'' waveform at duplex.\citep{mahmoud2015}
While small pseudoaneurysms can be managed without intervention or
surgery, larger pseudoaneurysms, pseudoaneurysms associated with
infection or overlying skin changes or bleeding may require excision and
repair.\citep{bandyk2013}

\uline{Steal syndrome:}~Hemodialysis-related steal, also known as
access-related hand ischemia, which may occur in over half of all
patients undergoing access creation. Steal is characterized by
retrograde diastolic flow distal to the donor artery. Of note, reversal
of flow in and of itself is not sufficient to cause distal ischemia with
an intact palmar arch. This is commonly seen after access creation and
represents physiologic steal phenomenon, rather than symptomatic steal
syndrome. Digital pressures \textless60 mm Hg are highly sensitive and specific
for predicting steal. Patients who have no symptoms (Grade 1
access-related hand ischemia), may be closely monitored without any
intervention.

\textbf{How do we treat more severe steal?}

Flow rate measurements of the fistula can help determine the optimal
treatment (banding, revision using distal inflow, distal
revascularization with interval ligation, proximalization of arterial
inflow or ligation of the fistula). For more on steal, see
\ref{sec-steal-syndrome}

\textbf{So steal can occur in the context of high fistula output, can we talk
a bit about low fistula flow, as from stenosis?}

\uline{Central venous stenosis:} Venous outflow stenosis is the
most common reason for arteriovenous graft failure. A low flow rate
results in recirculation during the dialysis session. Venous obstruction
manifests as arm swelling, and with central venous stenosis may present
with collateral development over the upper extremity and chest wall.

\uline{Stenosis of fistula:}~Arterial and mid-graft stenosis can
also cause complications, but are less common than venous stenosis.
Stenosis on imaging will be represented by narrowing of luminal diameter
of 50\% (which correlates to a 75\% reduction in cross-sectional area) on
b-mode ultrasound, PSV\textgreater400, Vr \textgreater2,5, high-resistance waveform proximal
to the stenosis, and tardus parvus waveform distal to the
stenosis.\citep{bandyk2013}

\hypertarget{lower-extremity}{%
\section{Lower Extremity}\label{lower-extremity}}

\textbf{Can you please tell us about some of the diagnostic modalities that
are used to examine perfusion in the lower extremities?}

\uline{ABIs:}~Ankle-brachial index measurement requires
calculating the ratio of the highest ankle systolic pressure (posterior
tibial artery or dorsalis pedis) over the highest brachial systolic
pressure. Regardless of whether you're doing the R or L ABI, use the
higher arm pressure for both ratios. Normal ABI \textgreater0.9, severe disease
indicated by ABI\textless0.5, and CLI by ABI\textless0.3.

The ankle-brachial index in diabetic patients is frequently unreliable
due to incompressibility of the tibial vessels at the level of the cuff
secondary to calcification. Consequently, toe pressures are mandatory in
all patients with diabetes mellitus. Normal TBI\textgreater0.7.

Of note, monophasic waveforms in the brachial artery likely represent
proximal occlusive disease in the upper extremity and therefore make the
ABI non-diagnostic because the upper extremity blood pressure is not
likely not representative of central blood pressure.\citep{chen2014}

\uline{TcPO2:}~When there is significant tissue loss, preventing
TBI measurement, another option is transcutaneous oximetry
(TcPO2).\citep{mills2014} Transcutaneous oximetry is a non-invasive method of
measuring the tissue partial pressure of oxygen through a heated sensor
on the skin. A TcPO2 value of 40 mmHg is the critical value below which
wound healing is impaired and ischemia develops.

\textbf{Are there other non-invasive ways of determining extremity
perfusion?}

\uline{PVRs:}~Pulse volume recordings. Normal PVR waveforms have a
rapid upstroke, sharp peak, prominent dicrotic notch and downslope.
Typically 4 cuffs. High thigh cuff should be 30\% greater than brachial
pressure, hence a thigh-brachial index of 1.3 is normal. However,
ABI/PVRs may not demonstrate significantly abnormal values/waveforms in
individuals with single level disease.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide13}

\uline{Exercise Test:}~During exercise testing, patients are
placed on a treadmill after baseline resting ABIs are measured. The
patient is then asked to walk for 5 minutes or until physical discomfort
requires test cessation. The point when patient reports pain starts is
the initial claudication distance and the point where the patient stops
is defined as the absolute claudication distance. Diagnostic criteria
for a positive test include a drop-in ankle pressure of greater than 20
mmHg from baseline, drop in ABI greater than 0.2 from baseline, or
inability of ankle pressures to return to baseline after 3
minutes.\citep{strandness1964}

\textbf{So just to briefly summarize, what are parameters associated with poor
wound healing?}

\uline{Parameters associated with poor wound healing:}~Considering
these various testing modalities, what are factors associated with poor
likelihood of wound healing? An ankle pressure \textless50 mmHg, ABI \textless{} 0.40,
TcPO2 \textless20 mmHg, or a toe pressure \textless20 mmHg are considered predictive
of non-healing.

\textbf{What is the utility of duplex in diagnosing lower extremity occlusive
disease?}

Duplex ultrasound is utilized to further delineate the anatomy, level
and severity of occlusive disease. Increased PSV can identify the site
of a hemodynamically significant stenosis. Diminished waveforms often
suggest more proximal disease.

Of note, diffuse narrowing of the SFA can result in tardus et parvus
waveforms in the popliteal, without necessarily demonstrating any areas
of high velocity.\citep{aburahma2022, pellerito2019}

While duplex ultrasound most easily visualises infrainguinal arterieal
disease, it can also be used to evaluate for iliac artery stenosis.
Patients with an iliac Vr\textgreater2.5 or monophasic/biphasic waveforms in the
CFA, suggest that further imaging of the iliac system may be
required.\citep{heinen2018}

\textbf{Ultrasound is frequently used for graft surveillance. Can you talk
about graft surveillance parameters?}

Suggested bypass vein graft surveillance with ABI, clinical exam and
duplex should begin immediately after surgery and then continues at 3,
6, and 12 months and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter.\citep{conte2006, zierler2018} A velocity ratio (Vr) is often utilized in graft
surveillance and is defined as the peak systolic velocity (PSV) at the
site of a stenosis divided by the PSV in a normal vessel segment
proximal to the stenosis.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The highest risk for graft thrombosis, and highest cause for concern
  is suggested by PSV \textgreater300 cm/s, Vr \textgreater3.5, a mid-graft flow velocity
  \textless45 cm/s or a drop in ABI \textgreater0.15.
  \citep{bandykHemodynamicsVeinGraft1988, zierler2018}
\item
  Increased risk grafts have a PSV 180-300 cm/s and a Vr 2.0-3.5.
\item
  Spectral pulse wave doppler is more sensitive than color doppler to
  identify low flow states or thrombosed grafts.\citep{hedrick2005}
\item
  Criteria for prosthetic grafts is higher than vein bypass.
  \citep{zierler2018}
\end{itemize}

Intervention for recurrent vein bypass graft stenosis early after
angioplasty may be best treated with an open revision and patch
plasty.\citep{jongsma2016}

Presenting with new swelling, pain and fluid around a prosthetic graft
on duplex ultrasound may be a sign of underlying graft infection. PET
and WBC scans may be positive up to 4mo after implantation, so do not
provide much utility in the early post-operative period.\citep{puges2019}

\hypertarget{pathologies}{%
\subsection{Pathologies}\label{pathologies}}

\textbf{Let's talk about pathologies frequently encountered in the lower
extremities:}

\hypertarget{psa}{%
\subsubsection{Pseudoaneurysms (particularly femoral)}\label{psa}}

Gray-scale ultrasonography demonstrates a hypoechoic cystic structure
adjacent to an arterial supply. Color Doppler typically demonstrates a
``yin-yang sign'' within the pseudoaneurysm sac. The hallmark ultrasound
sign is identification of a neck between the sac and the feeding artery
with a ``to-and-fro'' spectral Doppler waveform measured at the neck. This
represents the flow in and out of the PSA during systole and diastole.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide14}

Anastomotic pseudoaneurysms develop in around 3\% of femoral anastomoses
and can be associated with arterial wall weakness, endarterectomy,
mismatch between artery/graft, dilation/deterioration of graft material,
increased/uneven tension of anastamosis, underlying
infection.\citep{pellerito2019}

\hypertarget{dissections}{%
\subsubsection{Dissections}\label{dissections}}

Characteristic ultrasound findings on color Doppler include a parallel
blood-flow channel that separates the true and false lumen, with
diminished blood flow distally.\citep{ge2015, kobayashi2018} Traumatic
intimal flaps after knee dislocation can have a normal ABI and be
asymptomatic, but they should be followed as they can
progress.\citep{gaitini2008} Of note, if the false lumen is filled by a
thrombus, it may not distinguishable from an intramural hematoma or
noncalcified plaque

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide15}

\hypertarget{buerger}{%
\subsubsection{Buerger's Disease}\label{buerger}}

Rare disease, but with characteristic findings on ultrasound of
serpiginous/corkscrew collaterals, occlusion of distal calf/pedal
arteries, and normal proximal arteries.\citep{busch2011, fujii2011}

For more see \ref{buergers-disease}

\textbf{There are several disease pathologies that are frequently tested
relating to the popliteal fossa. Can you talk briefly about these?}

\hypertarget{cad}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Cystic Adventitial Disease}}{Cystic Adventitial Disease}}\label{cad}}

This is a rare (but often tested) pathology. Adventitial cystic disease
is a non-atherosclerotic etiology of claudication, most often affecting
the popliteal artery in the lower extremity and leading to stenosis or
occlusion. Duplex imaging of the popliteal artery will demonstrate an
anechoic or hypoechoic \emph{intraluminal} region with a smooth contour and
stenosis documented by velocity increase on spectral doppler.
Angiography will often show a classic ``scimitar'' sign - smooth well
defined crescent-shaped defect.\citep{shaw2007, winn2015}

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide16}

For more on adventitial cystic disease, see
\ref{cystic-adventitial-disease}. This is not to be confused with:

\hypertarget{bakers-cyst}{%
\subsubsection{Bakers Cyst}\label{bakers-cyst}}

A benign, cystic structure found in the popliteal fossa and arising from
the joint capsule. Flexion of the knee may result in compression of the
popliteal artery by the cyst. On b-mode ultrasound, a well-defined,
anechoic~ cystic structure with a `neck' extending into the joint space
between the semimembranosus tendon and the medial head of the
gastrocnemius will be identified.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide17}

\uline{Popliteal entrapment syndrome:}~decrease in ABI or loss of
distal pulses with passive dorsiflexion or active plantar flexion of the
foot caused by compression of the popliteal artery by the gastrocnemius.

\hypertarget{abdominal}{%
\section{Abdominal}\label{abdominal}}

\hypertarget{aorta}{%
\subsection{Aorta}\label{aorta}}

\textbf{Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA):} Ultrasound screening of a AAA is
non-invasive, accurate, and cost-effective.\citep{chaikof2018}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sensitivity of 98\% and specificity of 99\% for AAA
  diagnosis.\citep{wilmink2002}
\item
  Aneurysm is measured in transverse view, anterior to posterior
  diameter, outer wall to outer wall.\citep{iac2021} Size criteria for AAA
  repair is 5.5 cm men, 5.0-5.5 cm in women.
\item
  Can be limited by bowel gas or obesity - so recommend fasting
\item
  For more details, see\ref{abdominal-aneurysms}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Can ultrasound be used for graft surveillance s/p EVAR?}

Surveillance color duplex ultrasound is safe if CT imaging at 1 year
exhibits no sac growth, graft migration, or endoleak (or stable type II
endoleak). Contrast enhanced duplex, in particular, has a high
sensitivity and specificity to detect endoleaks.\citep{abraha2017, kapetanios2019, chaer2009}

Type II endoleaks classification is subdivided on surveillance duplex.
Type IIa has a single inflow vessel and a ``to-and-fro'' appearance,
whereas Type IIb has multiple vessels and maintains a monophasic flow.
Type IIa endoleaks with velocities greater than 100cm/sec are not likely
to spontaneously resolve and may be resistant to therapy.\citep{arko2003, vanmarrewijk2004}

Type II endoleaks with stable sac size can continue surveillance with
color duplex.\citep{chaikof2018, karthikesalingam2012, chaer2009} Any
findings concerning for growth, endoleak or flow in the sac should have
confirmatory CTA performed.\citep{maleux2017}

Surveillance duplex does not reliably detect graft migration given
challenge of renal arteries visualization in a long axis view of the
aorta.\citep{busch2009}

Velocities within stents are elevated from baseline due to stent
rigidity, but a limb velocity \textgreater300cm/s with a Vr \textgreater3.5 is associated
with a high risk of limb occlusion from stenosis or kinking and should
undergo further investigation or intervention.\citep{chaikof2018, blom2012}

\textbf{What other pathologies can be identified on ultrasound evaluation of
the abdomen?}

\uline{CIA aneurysms:}~SVS defines CIA aneurysms as any permanent,
localized dilatation of the iliac artery \textgreater1.5 cm in diameter (diameter
1.5x the normal diameter)

\uline{Para-anastomotic pseudoaneurysms:}~As previously discussed
(reported in up to 0.5\% to 10\% of cases)

\uline{Penetrating aortic ulcers:}~Describes an ulcerating
atherosclerotic lesion that penetrates the intima and progresses into
the media. Associated with atherosclerotic plaque on ultrasound

\uline{Dissections:}~(as already discussed) a dissection flap is
usually identified and color flow demonstrates dual channels (true and
false lumens). Turbulent flow patterns are frequently encountered.

\hypertarget{mesenteric-vasculature}{%
\subsection{Mesenteric Vasculature}\label{mesenteric-vasculature}}

\textbf{So far we have steered clear of the mesenteric vasculature. But this
is an area frequently encountered on exams. Let's start with mesenteric
vessel stenosis.}

\textbf{Celiac and SMA stenosis:} May present as chronic mesenteric ischemia.
PSV \textgreater275 cm/s in the SMA or \textgreater200 cm/s in the celiac artery indicates
\textgreater=70\% stenosis. Normal SMA Doppler waveforms in the fasting patient
show high resistance waveform, PSV \textless275 cm/s and no spectral
broadening. In the postprandial state, the waveform becomes low
resistance, with a slightly increased PSV and little to no spectral
broadening. Significant SMA stenosis may be differentiated by the
presence of spectral broadening and elevated PSV (\textgreater275cm/s) and EDV
(\textgreater55cm/s).\citep{aburahma2012, oderich2019} Distal to the stenosis, one
would expect a tardus parvis waveform. EDV \textgreater45 in SMA or \textgreater55 in celiac
are predictive of stenosis (would expect higher diastolic flow in celiac
trunk given low resistance vascular bed of liver and spleen).

Reversal of flow in the hepatic artery and mildly elevated SMA
velocities may indirectly signify severe stenosis or occlusion of the
celiac artery.

Note that aberrant anatomy with the hepatic artery arising from the SMA,
will result in the proximal SMA demonstrating a low resistance waveform,
even in the fasted state.\citep{pellerito2019}

Mesenteric duplex is still valid even if the patient has not fasted. The
images may be technically more difficult to acquire due to bowel gas,
however if velocities can be obtained, you a re likely to see elevate
PSV and low resistance waveform in the SMA. The EDV will also be
elevated and should be interpreted with caution.

\textbf{IMA Stenosis:} PSV \textgreater200 cm/s or aortic ratio \textgreater2.5 has a high
sensitivity for hemodynamically significant stenosis. However, this is
rarely clinically significant and does not require treatment.

\textbf{What other mesenteric vessel pathologies may be identified on vascular
ultrasound?}

\uline{Dissections:} Rare without concomitant aortic dissection,
describe only in case reports.\citep{gouëffic2002, oglesby2006}

\uline{Aneurysms:}~Rare. Repair \textgreater2 cm celiac, hepatic, SMA
aneurysms and \textgreater3 cm splenic and renal.

\uline{Median arcuate ligament syndrome:} MALS can cause
significantly elevated velocities at the origin of the celiac artery.
Testing is for reversible mechanical compression, as opposed to a fixed
lesion from atherosclerotic disease. During deep inspiration or in the
upright position the MAL is elevated and celiac velocities should
normalize if stenosis is secondary to MALS.\citep{tembey2015}

\uline{Hepatic artery thrombosis:} Mesenteric duplex is often
performed in liver transplant patients. Hepatic artery thrombosis most
often occurs within the first 30d after liver transplantation, with an
incidence of 1.5-9\% and a mortality rate of 75\%.\citep{garcía-criado2009, sanyal2012}

\hypertarget{portal-vein}{%
\subsection{Portal Vein}\label{portal-vein}}

\textbf{So I recognize that we are jumping ahead here discussing venous
circulation, but as this represents another component of a mesenteric
vascular exam, let's discuss portal venous ultrasonography.}

Normal portal venous flow is hepatopetal (toward the liver), whereas
abnormal portal venous flow is hepatofugal (away from the liver). (The
root ``fugua'' means to flee, or flight). Flow should be in the same
direction as the hepatic artery.

Other abnormalities that may be visualized are portal vein
thrombosis---often associated with portal venous hypertension in
patients with chronic cirrhosis, hepatitis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.
Acute portal vein thrombosis on ultrasound demonstrates dilatation of
the portal vein with hypoechoic intraluminal thrombus. Chronic portal
vein thrombosis is characterized by a contracted vein with
heterogeneous/hyperechoic echoes and may be associated with collateral
formation.\citep{chawla2015, nouvini2013}

Mesenteric duplex can also assess for functioning of TIPS (transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). A sign of a failing TIPS is portal
vein peak systolic velocity less than 30cm/s.

\hypertarget{renal-arteries}{%
\subsection{Renal arteries}\label{renal-arteries}}

\textbf{Awesome, and so before jumping fully into venous circulation, let's
complete our discussion of abdominal ultrasound evaluation with a
discussion of the renal vasculature.}

\uline{Renal Pathologies:}~ostial (atherosclerotic) vs mid-artery
(FMD)

\uline{Atherosclerotic stenosis:}~PSV \textgreater{} 285 cm/s and Renal-aortic
ratio (RAR) \textgreater3.5, suggests \textgreater60\% stenosis.\citep{schäberle2016} However
aortic PSV needs to be within normal range (40-100) to be appropriately
interpreted.

The renal resistive index (RRI) is calculated as the RA (PSV-EDV)/PSV.
The RRI (\textgreater0.8) is an indicator of intrinsic parenchymal renal disease.
RRI has been used for assessment of transplant renal allograft
rejection, decision making for treatment of renal artery stenosis, and
evaluate progression of CKD. Diabetic nephropathy will demonstrate
elevated RRI, signifying parenchymal disease.\citep{viazzi2014} One study
showed it was associated with poor renal and overall outcome in
critically ill patients.\citep{ledorze2012}

\uline{FMD:} Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) will demonstrate
tortuous renal arteries with turbulent flow and increased PSV of the
mid-distal portions. Beading may be difficult to see on ultrasound
(compared to the extra-cranial carotid). Atherosclerosis disease is
primarily ostial in nature.

\uline{In stent restenosis}: Higher cut off values are required to
determine in stent restenosis.\citep{chi2009, schäberle2016}

\uline{Renal artery aneurysms:} Can see a yin-yang sign.
\citep{gutta2008, ham2014}

\hypertarget{venous}{%
\section{Venous}\label{venous}}

\textbf{Venous Exam:}~Uses a linear transducer. Complete deep venous reflux
duplex examination includes color and pulsed wave spectral doppler
imaging. Spontaneous Doppler waveforms as well as provocative maneuvers
are recorded in the common femoral, femoral, popliteal, and tibial deep
veins. Superficial veins (GSV, SSV, and perforator veins) are evaluated
with provocative maneuvers to test valve competency. Diameters are also
included for superficial veins. Transverse B-mode images are used for
vessel compression (as when looking for thrombus) to ensure that the
vein is fully compressible under probe pressure as opposed to simply
slipping out of view, as may occur in longitudinal views. Reflux exam
should be performed with a patient standing, with assessment performed
on the non weight-bearing leg.

\textbf{We've talked extensively about normal arterial waveforms; what do
normal venous waveforms look like?}

\uline{Normal venous waveforms:}~Normal flow patterns of iliac and
femoral veins demonstrate phasicity and should augment with distal
compression. In the upper extremity central veins, doppler waveforms
normally demonstrate pulsatility and phasicity.

\textbf{What does this mean? Pulsatility, phasicity, and augmentation}?

\textbf{Pulsatility:}~Refers to changes in the venous waveform in accordance
with the cardiac cycle. Pulsatility is normal in the upper extremity
veins central veins, given their proximity to the heart.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide18}

This is an abnormal finding in the lower extremity veins, and may be a
sign of pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, or tricuspid
regurgitation.

\textbf{Phasicity:} (also called respiratory phasicity) is variation in the
waveform with respiration. This results from increasing and decreasing
intrathoracic pressures secondary to respiration. Phasicity is an
indicator of a patency proximal to the point of measurement. So if we
see lack of phasicity (continuous flow) in the left femoral vein but
normal phasicity in the right, we would be concerned for left iliac vein
occlusion or stenosis. If we saw absence of phasicity (continuous flow)
in the bilateral femoral veins, we would be concerned for IVC
obstruction or stenosis.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide19}

\textbf{Augmentation:}~Distal compression that augments forward flow. For
example, if we are measuring flow at the femoral vein and we squeeze the
calf and we see augmentation in the waveform, this indicates lack of
occlusion in the venous system from the knee to the probe.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide20}

\textbf{What are venous pathologies that are commonly tested/encountered?}

\uline{Reflux:}~Venous reflux due to valvular incompetence is best
assessed with duplex scanning in the upright position. Reflux in the
common femoral vein and the saphenofemoral junction may be elicited with
a Valsalva maneuver (which increases intra-abdominal pressure), but
release of a pneumatic cuff compression is a more reproducible method.
Reflux is identified as reverse flow - that is, away from the heart -
following valsalva or release of the compression cuff.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide21}

Consensus guidelines suggest a cutoff value of 1 second for abnormally
reversed flow (reflux) in the femoral and popliteal veins and of 0.5
seconds for the great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein, tibial, and
deep femoral veins.

\uline{Perforator veins:}~Perforator veins connect the deep and
superficial venous systems, penetrating the deep fascia overlying the
muscle.~ Size \textgreater3.5 mm and reflux \textgreater350 ms (deep to superficial) is
associated with perforator reflux. Pathological perforator = in
association with a healed or non-healed ulcer.

\textbf{What are some other examples of reflux?}

\uline{Ovarian vein reflux:}~The ultrasound evaluation of pelvic
congestion syndrome is performed in steep reverse Trendelenburg and
standing positions with a low-frequency probe. Reflux is identified
during the Valsalva maneuver. There are no validated criteria for the
duration of reflux. Rather, an ovarian vein diameter \textgreater6 mm is
considered significant.

\uline{May Thurner}\textbf{:}~Also known as iliac vein compression
syndrome, refers to a chronic compression of the left~\href{https://radiopaedia.org/articles/common-iliac-vein?lang=us}{common iliac
vein} by the
overlying right~\href{https://radiopaedia.org/articles/common-iliac-artery?lang=us}{common iliac
artery}~(CIA),
with or without~\href{https://radiopaedia.org/articles/deep-vein-thrombosis?lang=us}{deep venous
thrombosis}.
Notably, patients present with unilateral (left) lower extremity edema
and pain, varicosities, DVT or venous ulcers. Intravascular ultrasound
will demonstrate \textgreater50\% stenosis of the iliac vein from compression.
Distal waveforms will demonstrate absence of phasicity if
obstruction/stenosis is severe with continuous flow.

\textbf{Ok, let's transition from reflux to thrombosis:}

\uline{Thrombosis:}~Characteristics of acute thrombus are an
echolucent and incompressible thrombus in a thin-walled vein with
significant distension.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide22}

Acute thrombus typically causes the vein to dilate with a diameter
greater than the diameter of the adjacent artery. Venous wall
thickening/scarring, a contracted vein, recanalization, and
collateralization is found in chronic thrombosis.

\textbf{Let's discuss 2 Specific examples of venous thrombosis: VTOS and
EHIT}

\uline{Venous TOS:}~Venous thoracic outlet syndrome is thrombosis
or severe stenosis of the subclavian or axillary veins secondary to
chronic extrinsic mechanical compression. Repetitive injury to the
subclavian vein at the level of the costoclavicular space results in
chronic injury to the veins. Venous duplex may show a dilated,
non-compressible vein consistent with an acute subclavian vein DVT, or
lack of pulsatility/phasicity if obstruction/stenosis is more centrally
located.

\uline{EHIT or Endovenous Heat Induced Thrombosis:}~S/p endovenous
thermal ablations (RFA or laser ablation) of the GSV. 4 Grades: Grade 1
is thrombus in the GSV up to the level of the CFV. If \textless{} 50\% of the CFV
lumen is involved this is EHIT grade 2. EHIT grade 3 is extension into
the CFV occupying \textgreater50\% of the lumen and grade 4 is occlusion of the
CFV.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide23}

EHIT grades 3-4 are typically treated with anticoagulation to reduce
risk of PE. To minimize the risk of EHIT, the catheter should be
positioned at least 2 cm from the saphenofemoral junction.

\hypertarget{artifacts}{%
\section{Artifacts}\label{artifacts}}

Finally, let's wrap up this episode with a discussion of imaging
artifacts. These are frequently encountered and tested in vascular
ultrasound, and it is important to recognize imaging artifacts in order
to prevent incorrect interpretation.

\textbf{Acoustic shadowing:}~Shadowing on an ultrasound image is
characterized by a signal void behind structures that strongly absorb,
reflect, or refract ultrasonic waves.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide24}

Practically speaking, this most typically occurs deep to strongly
reflective surfaces such as calcified plaques, and appears as a ``dark
area'' beneath the plaque.~\textbf{Acoustic enhancement}~is essentially the
inverse situation, and appears as a ``bright area'' deep to structures
that transmit ultrasound waves exceptionally well. This can happen deep
to fluid-filled structures such as cysts.

\textbf{Mirroring}: A mirror-image artifact is caused by reverberation of
ultrasound and shows structures that exist on one side of a strong
reflector as also being present on the other side of the reflector.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide25}

This is often seen around the pleura and the diaphragm, due to the
strong reflection of ultrasound from the air-filled lung. These
artifacts can occur in both B-mode imaging where you see the mirrored
image and Doppler, in which you see the mirrored waveform.

\textbf{Refraction:}~A refraction artifact is the result of ultrasound waves
passing through tissues with different propagation velocities (such as
air and water) and causes a structure to be improperly positioned
laterally in the image. This is the phenomenon that results in a straw
appearing bent when in a glass of water.

\textbf{Speed artifact:}~Depth determination by an ultrasound machine is
based on calculations using an average propagation velocity of sound in
soft tissue of 1540 m/s. If the ultrasound wave passes through a medium
at a different speed than predicted by the machine, an inaccurate image
depth will be displayed. If the ultrasound passes less quickly through
the material than soft tissue (as occurs in air or fluid), then the
image will be displayed deeper than the true depth. In practical
application, this is what causes a ``bayonet'' sign, or apparent bending
of a needle when it passes from soft tissue into a cystic structure.

\textbf{Inappropriate color gain:}~Overly gained images will show ``speckling''
in areas in which no flow is present (such as in soft tissue).
Increasing the gain, increases both the signal and the
noise.\citep{kremkau2021}

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide26}

Under-gaining will result in reduced sensitivity to low velocity flow.

\textbf{Inappropriate angle correction:}~Make sure the angle correction
cursor is centered in the vessel and parallel to the walls, otherwise
the Doppler velocity measurement will be incorrect.

Finally, can we talk about aliasing, as I feel like this comes up a lot
on exams:

\textbf{Aliasing:}~Unlike~\href{https://radiopaedia.org/articles/continuous-wave-doppler?lang=us}{continuous wave
Doppler},
pulsed wave and color flow Doppler are characterized by rapid pulses of
ultrasound waves (at a rate called the pulse repetition frequency).
The~\href{https://radiopaedia.org/articles/nyquist-limit?lang=us}{Nyquist
limit}~defines
the frequency at which aliasing will occur, as equal to the PRF/2. So
what does this mean practically? In pulsed wave doppler, if the velocity
of blood is greater than ½ the PRF, the peak velocity will be cut off,
and wrapped around to the bottom of the scale.

\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/vasc_lab/Slide28}

This results in inaccurate measurement of peak velocities, and may be
remedied by increasing the PRF and hence the scale. In color flow
doppler, aliasing appears as red to blue hues without separation of a
black region indicating no flow. This occurs in areas of high velocity
(such as immediately post-stenosis). This can be remedied with an
increase in the color scale. Of note, if asked to determine the
direction of blood flow in a vessel demonstrating aliasing, one should
assess the flow in low-velocity areas of blood flow, as seen along
vessel walls.

Endovascular procedures are the cornerstone of any modern vascular
surgery practice. Because most endovascular procedures are performed
percutaneously using arterial or venous access, it is critical that
vascular surgeons are facile with various techniques and devices used
for endovascular access. Today we'll be discussing the various access
sites, techniques for access, closure devices, and complications.

\textbf{What factors play a role when choosing a site for access?}

The factors to think about when thinking about which vessel to access
are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The appropriateness of the access site the procedure performed
\item
  Ability to obtain hemostasis at the conclusion of the procedure
\item
  Ability to convert to open if necessary
\item
  Effects of access on the tissues supplied by the accessed vessel and
  distal limb perfusion
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What makes a vessel appropriate for access?}

One of the most important factors when planning your access is the size
of the vessel. The vessel needs to be able to accommodate the catheters
and devices that will be used to perform the procedure. For instance, a
brachial artery with less than 4mm diameter should not be accessed by a
large bore sheaths, such as a 12Fr sheath.

The vessel also needs to be a in a location that can allow access to the
target vessel of interest. Additionally, the vessel needs to have an
area that is relatively healthy to access the vessel safely and minimize
complications. Heavily calcified vessels especially those with anterior
wall calcification might not be appropriate for access.

\textbf{What about the ability obtaining hemostasis at the end of the
procedure?}

The ability to obtain hemostasis is critical to be able to perform
endovascular procedures safely which is one reason why the common
femoral artery is the most commonly accessed vessel.

Hemostasis is most commonly achieved through manual compression by
compressing the artery against the femoral head. The brachial artery can
also be compressed against the humerus, but because it's a more mobile
vessel, compression is less effective and can lead to hematoma or
pseudoaneurysm formation which may necessitate an operation to prevent
compression of the median nerve

Patients who will need to be uninterruptedly anticoagulated peri and
postoperatively pose a challenge to hemostasis. The use of closure
devices is very important in these situations to prevent access
bleeding.

A variety of closure devices can also be used to assist in hemostasis,
each with their own inherent advantages and disadvantages. In general,
closure devices are contraindicated in small diameter and heavily
calcified vessels.

\textbf{In any minimally invasive procedure, there is always a chance that you
may need to convert to open. How does converting to open play a role in
vascular access?}

Conversion to open is uncommon with vessel access accounting for \textless5\% of
the cases. Sometimes a large sheath is accidentally pulled out and a
cutdown becomes necessary to repair the artery. Closure devices aren't
100\% effective in hemostasis and may also require a cutdown for
definitive control if they fail, especially when obtaining large bore
access.

This makes choosing the right vessel critical. For example, if a large
sheath is accidentally pulled out of the CFA during an EVAR, the repair
can be done through a straightforward groin cutdown. In contrast, the
subclavian artery is rarely accessed percutaneously because converting
to open would require a more challenging peri-clavicular incision or
even a thoracotomy for repair.

\textbf{Large diameter sheaths are often used, particularly in aortic
procedures. These sheaths can be occlusive which can result in
downstream tissue ischemia. What considerations should be taken when
thinking about downstream tissue ischemia?}

When performing diagnostic procedures using small diameter sheaths and
catheters, anticoagulation may or may not be necessary depending on how
diseased the access vessel is.

However, when using large devices (e.g.~in EVARs), the sheaths can be
partially or completely occlusive which mandates full anticoagulation to
prevent thrombosis. The other thing to consider is the length of time
that the sheath remains in the vessel as the leg can only tolerate
ischemia for 4-6 hours. This is usually pertinent when performing
complex endovascular aortic procedures.

To minimize downstream tissue ischemia, a large bore sheath should be
pulled back to decrease the length of vessel obstruction by its shaft in
order to unblock proximal vessel collateral branch vessels. For
instance, when performing an aortic procedure through a femoral access
attempt to pull the sheath back into the external iliac artery to
increase distal limb perfusion through the internal to femoral artery
collateral branch vessels.~~

The long story short is to be liberal with anticoagulation when there is
reduced flow in the vessel such as the iliofemoral system during EVAR or
tibial access

\textbf{Do the principles that we've described also apply to veins?}

The same principles apply but there are some notable differences between
arterial and venous access.

Veins are a low-pressure system, so hemostasis is easier to achieve and
hemorrhagic complications are much less common. However, this poses a
challenge during access as there is less radial force keeping the vein
open making the vein more susceptible to compression by the ultrasound
probe and the needle.

If a large bore sheath is necessary to perform a venous procedure, a
suture-mediated closure device can be utilized to achieve hemostasis
especially in patients that will be kept fully anticoagulated

Additionally, a syringe may be needed to confirm access and can also
prevent air embolism

\textbf{Let's talk about accessing the common femoral artery. Why is the CFA
the most common vessel used for access?}

It is large caliber and can accommodate large sheaths up to 26-28 Fr.~It
also allows for a wide set of procedures and is ergonomically easy to
work with given its location. It is relatively easy to hold manual
pressure and if a conversion to open is needed, a femoral cutdown is
relatively straightforward.

\textbf{Where in the common femoral artery is the best spot to access?}

The ideal puncture site is in the CFA in the medial third of the femoral
head in between the inguinal ligament and the femoral bifurcation in the
middle of the femoral head.

Accessing the vessel above the inguinal ligament makes compressing the
artery very difficult which can lead to life-threatening retroperitoneal
bleed.

A puncture that is too distal and into the SFA increase the risk of
thrombosis or dissection causing acute limb ischemia as well as AV
fistula formation between the superficial femoral and profunda femoris
artery.

\textbf{What are the different ways to obtain CFA access?}

There are three different ways to access the CFA: manual palpation,
fluoroscopic guided, and ultrasound guided.

With manual palpation, a finger is placed above and below the desired
access point directly on the pulse and the needle is inserted in between
the two fingers.

Fluoroscopic guidance uses bony landmarks relative to the position of
the needle.

The standard of care in the modern era for obtaining CFA access is to
use ultrasound guidance. Ultrasound allows visualization of the vessel
and surrounding structures. PAD within the vessel can readily be
identified with ultrasound, allowing safe access in a relatively
disease-free part of the artery. Ultrasound also clearly shows the
femoral bifurcation. Using ultrasound allows for subtle corrections in
the angle of the needle and how it interacts with the surrounding
tissues. It is rapid, real-time, inexpensive, and safe.

\textbf{What anatomic considerations should be taken when accessing the CFA?}

The CFA is the continuation of the external iliac artery as it courses
under the inguinal ligament. It is about 5-8 cm in length and then
bifurcates in to the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries

The inguinal ligament is a good external landmark to estimate where the
CFA is. It is critical to emphasize that the inguinal ligament does not
correspond to the groin crease and this is especially true in obese
patients. An imaginary line is drawn from the ASIS to the pubic
tubercle. The artery generally runs a third of the way from the pubic
tubercle to the ASIS. A metallic instrument can be placed in this area
to mark it externally and a fluoroscopic image can be obtained to
identify the relation of the instrument to the medial third of the
femoral head. This imaginary line also marks the superior-most extent of
the access

The CFA is most often accessed in a retrograde fashion in between the
inguinal ligament and femoral bifurcation. This allows for a multitude
of potential diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in most parts of the
body.

\textbf{Can the CFA be accessed antegrade?}

Yes. Sometimes antegrade CFA access is used when performing an
intervention distal on the ipsilateral leg. The advantage of antegrade
access is better pushability and torquability of wires, catheters, and
sheaths when performing complex peripheral intervention where no other
proximal procedures are needed.

Antegrade access is more challenging than retrograde access, however.
This is particularly true in patients with a very short CFA, short
distance between the inguinal ligament and the femoral bifurcation
because the needle requires a steeper angle of entry to allow for
cannulation well above the femoral bifurcation.

Obtaining antegrade access is especially difficult in obese patients and
will usually require an assistant to retract the pannus to allow proper
needle placement. I would say antegrade access is relatively
contra-indicated in morbidly obese patients with large pannus.
Ultrasound guidance remains key here as well.

\textbf{What are some other commonly accessed arteries for endovascular
procedures?}

The tibial vessels can be accessed percutaneously for retrograde
recanalization for severe LE PAD. It is usually performed using
micropuncture kits which we will discuss a little later. It is usually
done with ultrasound guidance and uses small sheaths and wires. The PT
and AT are more commonly used because they are easier to access.

The radial artery is commonly used in coronary interventions and is
increasingly being used by vascular surgeons. It is easily palpable over
the distal radius and can be cannulated with ease. Hemostasis is
straightforward using compression. In the rare setting of radial
occlusion, the hand rarely becomes ischemic because most people are
ulnar dominant. It can accommodate sheaths up to 6 French.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The best way to reduce vasospasm and injury to the radial artery is
  utilizing a radial artery cocktail - calcium channel blocker,
  vasodilator, and anticoagulation.\citep{mason2018, cauley2019}
\end{itemize}

The brachial artery can be accessed percutaneously over the olecranon
process with the arm supinated.\citep{alvarez-tostado2009} Ultrasound
guidance allows for visualization of the brachial bifurcation. It can
accommodate 6-7 Fr sheaths. Hemostasis is critically important as
bleeding can result in a hematoma that results in median nerve
compression, which is a surgical emergency. Cut down after brachial
access has been shown to reduce complications.\citep{kret2016}

\textbf{Let's not forget about venous access. What are some of the most
commonly accessed veins?}

The CFV is commonly accessed for procedures involving the IVC and iliac
vessels and their branches for conditions such as May-Thurner, pelvic
congestion syndrome, and IVC filter placement. Treatment of PE can also
be performed through the CFV. The CFV can easily be compressed over the
femoral head and is located medial to the CFA. Ultrasound guidance
should be used to prevent arterial injury and backwalling.

The internal jugular vein can be accessed using US guidance (to prevent
carotid injury; IJ is lateral to the carotid). IJ access is used most
commonly for central venous catheters as well as IVC placement and
filter retrieval. It is also an excellent access to treat pulmonary
embolism via thrombolysis or thrombectomy. The IJ can be utilized to
perform ovarian and internal iliac vein embolization. IJ is also the
preferred access to perform TIPS, which is often of less interest to
vascular surgeon.

The popliteal vein can be accessed with the patient in the prone
position or the distal femoral vein in the supine position to diagnose
and treat DVTs of the extremity veins. Ultrasound is also helpful to
avoid arterial access and especially if the vein is thrombosed

Arm veins (cephalic/basilic) can be also readily accessed for vein
mapping or fistula interventions.

\textbf{Let's move on to access technique. Historically, there are two types
of puncture needles: single-wall and double-wall. Can you talk about the
differences?}

Double wall needles were commonly used back in the day for femoral
access. They have an outer hollow blunt-tipped needle and an inner sharp
stylet. The needle was inserted through and through the artery and the
stylet removed and the blunt hollow needle pulled back until blood is
returned. These aren't favored anymore because they cause unnecessary
backwalling of the artery. Double wall access kits are used in treating
endoleaks from both a transcaval and translumbar routes to allow access
into the aneurysm sack and needle removal to avoid puncturing the
endograft.

Single wall needles are typically the choice for diagnostic procedures.
18-gauge needles accommodate an 0.035 in wire and 21 gauge accommodates
a 0.018 in wire.

\textbf{Can you describe the micropuncture technique for percutaneous
access?}

Micropuncture technique is the most commonly used method for
percutaneous access nowadays. The advantage of the micropuncture
technique is the use of a small needle which can be removed and
repositioned with a negligible risk of bleeding and minimal amount of
manual compression needed.

Ultrasound is used to cannulate the artery with a 21-gauge needle. It is
best to visualize the needle entering the artery and to be intraluminal
without being against the wall Blood return is then seen and a floppy
tip micropuncture (0.018) wire is inserted under fluoroscopic guidance
to make sure the wire passes into the vessel easily. A 4 Fr introducer
sheath is placed over the wire gently to avoid kinking the wire. The
inner cannula of the sheath is removed, and a 0.035 guidewire is placed
under fluoroscopic guidance. It is important to remember that there are
two types of introducer sheath depending on amount of subcutaneous scar
tissue containing either a soft or a stiffened cannula. The 4 Fr is
removed over the wire while holding manual pressure and desired sheath
(usually 5 or 6 Fr) is placed for definitive access. The side port is
then aspirated for arterial blood and flushed with heparinized saline.

\section{Complications}\label{access-comp}}

\textbf{With any invasive procedure, there are risks of complications. What
are some of the complications of percutaneous vascular access?}

Hematomas are the most common complication and have an incidence of
about 3\%. Most of these hematomas are clinically insignificant but
retroperitoneal hemorrhage from a high puncture above the inguinal
ligament can be life-threatening. These may require conversion to open
and direct repair of the vessel or covered stent placement (especially
if the puncture is above the inguinal ligament). Proximal balloon
occlusion can be helpful to control hemorrhage while the vessel is being
repaired.

Groin hematomas are not uncommon and are usually self-limiting. An
expanding hematoma that is seen early can be treated with simple manual
pressure at the bedside. If the hematoma is large and compressing
surrounding structures or threatening skin integrity or if the patient
is hemodynamically unstable, then surgical evacuation may be necessary

Pseudoaneurysms are an uncommon complication with an incidence of about
0.6\%. Most pseudoaneurysms are treated with ultrasound-guided
compression or thrombin injection. Thrombin injection requires a narrow
neck into the pseudoaneurysm. If the pseudoaneurysm is \textgreater2cm, compresses
surrounding structures, threatens skin integrity, or has failed thrombin
injection, then surgical repair is required.\citep{morgan2003, stone2014}
For a representative image, see \ref{psa}

Thrombosis of the CFA is a known complication but fortunately is rare
with an incidence of 0.2\%. This can result from manual compression of
the CFA that has severe atherosclerotic disease or prior groin
reconstruction. This generally requires a cutdown, endarterectomy,
thrombectomy, and patch angioplasty.

Lastly, AV fistula can form and are usually between the femoral artery
and vein with an incidence of 0.5-0.9\%). These usually occur from a low
puncture of the CFA bifurcation or profunda. They are usually
asymptomatic and detected on exam (palpable thrill) and confirmed with
duplex imaging. If the fistula is small, it generally can be observed
with close duplex surveillance. If it enlarges or becomes symptomatic,
then repair is indicated. Covered stent grafts can be placed with
minimal morbidity, making this optimal for high risk patients. Open
surgery also is highly successful. Deciding between non-operative,
endovascular, or open treatment is up for debate and is up to the
clinical judgement of the surgeon.
