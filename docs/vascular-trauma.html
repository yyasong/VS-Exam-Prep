<p><strong>Initial principles of managing a bleeding extremity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DO NOT GET DISTRACTED
<ul>
<li>These patients are often poly-trauma patients with likely other
injuries</li>
<li>Follow ABCDEs of the primary survey
<ul>
<li>Identify bleed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding</li>
<li>Pressure can be manual pressure, such as placing a finger in
the wound, or applying a tourniquet</li>
<li>Once bleeding is effectively controlled, RESUSCITATE and
continue the primary survey to address other life
threatening injuries</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Rich’s Vascular Trauma Book, they described the injury extremity
index. Could you explain this concept?</strong></p>
<p>If I had to take one tool with me into resuscitation room or an austere
location to evaluate for vascular injury, it would be the continuous
wave Doppler. It’s only more powerful if you can combine it with a
manual blood pressure cuff and together allow one to obtain an objective
measure of perfusion. One can slowly inflate the blood pressure cuff,
just proximal to the arterial signal, kind of like taking a blood
pressure, and measure the pressure at which the arterial signal goes
away. That can then be compared to a normal or non-injured extremity. If
there is no flow limiting arterial injury, the ratio should be one or
slightly greater than one.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the ratio for the injured extremity is less than 0.9,
then that’s indicative of flow limiting injury in the artery to that
extremity. If the patient happens to be in shock or cold and clamped
down, the injured extremity index can be repeated 10 or 15 minutes later
as the patient is resuscitated and warmed.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-rasmussen2022" role="doc-biblioref">492</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p><strong>So what do you think the role of CTA is in the workup of extremity
with concern for vascular trauma?</strong></p>
<p>If there are hard signs of arterial injury, oftentimes the patient will
require an intervention without obtaining formal imaging. The question
about imaging often comes into play when there’s a soft sign of vascular
injury, such as a reduced injury extremity index, audible bruit, or
injury pattern. We spent decades saying that the traditional
arteriography was the gold standard, but I think we can say now that CTA
has become the gold standard for the evaluation of extremity vascular
injury. CTA has improved in quality and it can also get imaging of the
head, torso, or other other extremities.</p>
<p><strong>And so whether the patient has a hard sign or a soft sign with a
vascular injury, can you talk us through some of the principles of
operating on peripheral vascular trauma?</strong></p>
<p>Foremost important is to resuscitate the patient and to be mindful of
his or her physiology and hemodynamics. As we said, an extremity
vascular injury can be somewhat distracting. Make sure the patient is
being resuscitated and warmed, ventilator settings are being corrected,
and monitoring is in place – which takes a lot of communication with
the anesthesia team, the circulating nurse, the technicians, and the
blood bank.</p>
<p>I think once the patient is set and you have the team resuscitating him
or her, then you can turn your attention to the injured extremity. I
will prep that patient widely and be mindful that the incision is likely
to take more than what you think it will. For example, for an above the
knee popliteal artery, I will still prep that patient from their
umbilicus down to both legs; because you need to anticipate getting
proximal control, or doing an angiogram at the femoral artery level and
anticipate the potential harvesting of saphenous vein for conduit.</p>
<p>I also leave the tourniquet on and just prep it into the case. Taking
that tourniquet down prematurely can be problematic for a couple of
reasons. It may result in arterial bleeding, which in itself can be
catestrophic, but it can also result in hypotension which poses risk to
multiple organ systems. So, I just prep them into the field and then
communicate with anesthesia to tell them when I am going to let this
tourniquet down. Prior to doing so, I ensure they are ready, they have
blood going, and have a secondary measure to control bleeding as you let
that tourniquet down.</p>
<p>For the incisions, they just need to be probably twice as long as you
think they do. You can’t fix what you can’t see and if you can’t see it,
you can’t control it, and you certainly can’t repair it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you routinely heparinize all these patients?</strong></p>
<p>I hate to equivocate, but it depends. It depends on whether or not they
have other injuries. So if it’s an isolated extremity injury and the
patient does not have any torso bleeding, head trauma, or very extensive
soft tissue injury, then I will then be more inclined to use systemic
heparin during revascularization. If they have any of the above
injuries, then I will use regional heparin flushed up and down the
injured vessel.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-liang2016" role="doc-biblioref">493</a>,<a href="#ref-fox2012" role="doc-biblioref">494</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p><strong>One question that I’ve heard come up a handful of times is can you use
saphenous vein from the injured extremity?</strong></p>
<p>Our teaching, as you referenced, has always been to use a saphenous vein
from the contralateral extremity, but I am quite practical about it. I
certainly have used ipsilateral saphenous vein. If there’s no deep vein
injury and it’s part of the incision and exposure, then I will use
ipsilateral reversed greater saphenous vein. If there is concern for
deep venous injury or if I have another person to harvest and who can
prep the other leg, then often I’ll defer to that and use contralateral.
I’ll be more deferential to using the contralateral saphenous vein in
the reverse configuration.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-liang2016" role="doc-biblioref">493</a>,<a href="#ref-fox2012" role="doc-biblioref">494</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p><strong>So you have a vascular injury and you have debride it back to healthy
tissue. How do you make the decision between, primary repair, patch
repair, or interposition graft with autologous vein or prosthetic?</strong></p>
<p>You know, you can picture it now, you have vascular control with clamp
proximal and distal. Now you’re setting up, you are really shifting
gears into a different phase of this operation. It’s important to just
take a deep breath, I think at this point, and check with anesthesia and
make sure the patient’s doing all right from a global standpoint.</p>
<p>I think the other thing is that at this point, I have sometimes
overlooked the importance of performing a proximal and distal
thrombectomy using the Fogarty catheter. I’ll make sure that I’ve passed
a Fogarty catheter distally to completely clear the outflow of thrombus.
Then I’ll use regional heparin, 40-60cc of heparin saline down the
outflow before I apply the clamp. I’ll do the same in the inflow and
that buys you a little time as you’re sort of thinking about and sizing
up what’s in front of you.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-liang2016" role="doc-biblioref">493</a>,<a href="#ref-fox2012" role="doc-biblioref">494</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>I think in my experience, the majority of patients need an interposition
graft. Certainly, if it’s a grazing wound or a stab wound from a knife,
there may be a role for primary repair or patch. But if one thinks
there’s going to be any compromise of the arterial lumen or tension on
the repair, then you’re better off with an interposition.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-liang2016" role="doc-biblioref">493</a>,<a href="#ref-fox2012" role="doc-biblioref">494</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>There are some special cases where primary repair might be appropriate.
Veins are much more compliant and you can often get away with a lateral
venorrhaphy. Then sometimes the upper extremities, such as the brachial
artery, has more redundancy. If it’s a very focal injury and you can get
a little stretch, then you will often be able to get the brachial artery
back together primarily.</p>
<p>I suspect in the majority of my experience, vascular injuries require an
interposition graft. Then in regards to conduit, because most of the
wartime injuries were contaminated and quite dirty, we deferred to
autologous saphenous vein the vast majority of the time. However, if you
are in a pinch, can’t find vein or don’t have time to harvest vein, the
wound isn’t too contaminated, and the injury is proximal, axillary or
subclavian, proximal femoral, or iliac, then I think using a prosthetic,
either Dacron or expanded PTFE Gore-Tex is also acceptable. Some recent
civilian literature says PTFE may be better than vein, but that has not
been our experience in the deployed setting.</p>
<p><strong>Now that we have covered some basic principles, lets dive in a little
deeper on each kind of peripheral vascular injury. First we’re going to
talk about junctional hemorrhage, which is an injury in the junctional
area between the torso and extremity, such as the distal external
iliac/common femoral or subclavian/axillary region. These are some our
biggest fears and most difficult to deal with. Can you take us through a
hematoma in the groin or pelvis just above inguinal ligament–what are
the best ways to get control of this?</strong></p>
<p>For the iliac artery or even just the proximal common femoral, I think a
retroperitoneal exposure to the lower quadrant of the abdomen is
preferred. We sometimes refer to that as a transplant incision, which is
quite suitable depending upon the injury pattern.</p>
<p>As I alluded to before, don’t underestimate the exposure you’re going to
need. So, if it truly is a groin hematoma, think that this could be
common femoral or external iliac and in those cases, either a transplant
incision in a retroperitoneal fashion to get that controlled up to the
common iliac, or just doing a laparotomy and finding it through the
abdomen would suffice.</p>
<p><strong>What if you encountered an internal iliac injury deep in the pelvis
that you weren’t able to control, what are the consequences of ligating
that?</strong></p>
<p>That’s real tiger country, in those cases it’s really damaged control.
One of the things we haven’t mentioned is the important tenant – that
maybe arguably is one of the most important tenants in vascular damage
control – is ligation. We’ve talked a lot about setting up for a
vascular repair, but one of the reasons to check with anesthesia and to
assess the whole of the patient is to recognize that in some scenarios
the best thing is ligation and then dealing with whatever consequences
may result from that.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind, the idea of life over limb and not being too aggressive
about trying to do some sort of exposure and repair of a vessel that
takes hours and many, many units of blood. So in that context, I think,
if you find bleeding from the internal iliac or hypogastric vessels, I
think ligating those is quite acceptable. There can be instances of
pelvic ischemia, but if the contralateral iliac artery is open, then
that’s quite rare.</p>
<p>Also, often one is dealing with artery and vein injury because they’re
right there together. And as I mentioned, that’s real tiger country. If
that’s happening in those situations, keep in mind the tenants of
exposure, light, two suctions, and don’t use too small of a needle.
That’s where the SH blunt tip needle on a 3-0 or 4-0 prolene needle
works well. Don’t try to be too finesse about this because, in the
pelvis, you won’t be able to see your needle.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s take the same injury and move it now to the external iliac–what
are the consequences of ligating the external iliac artery and what are
some of your options?</strong></p>
<p>Because it’s the axial vessel to that extremity, I would not ligate the
external iliac artery with such impunity. I think in those situations,
controlling it and making that assessment of whether or not to repair it
is paramount. I think that the consequences of ligating an external
iliac artery are going to be significant and include proximal extremity
ischemia, including thigh, and probable need for above the knee
amputation and even disarticulation of the hip.</p>
<p>So I think the external iliac needs to be preserved at all costs. And
whether you reconstruct immediately or use a temporary vascular shunt as
a damage control is dependent upon how the patient’s doing or if you are
in the field and there are other triage concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Some can find shunts a little tricky, can you give some advice to
listeners on how to best use temporary vascular shunts for damage
control?</strong></p>
<p>I think it’s important to know what shunts you have available before you
are in this situation. So stroll through the operating room or your
stock room, wherever you are, when it’s not busy and check out the stock
of shunts. There are four or five different types of shunts, anything
from what’s referred to as the Javid shunt, Sundt shunt, or there’s the
Argyle shunt. Then there can be makeshift shunts, such as small caliber
chest tubes, which are temporary plastic tubes that can be placed into
the injured vessel proximally, and then controlled with either a
ligature around the vessel to lock that shunt place or a rubber vessel
loop.</p>
<p>And then you want to make sure that you did not blow out any clot with
that shunt. So you let some heartbeats go with red blood running through
the shunt, then occlude it with the clamp, and then insert it to the
vessel that is distal to the injury.</p>
<p>Likewise, you have to make sure that the thrombus has been removed, and
I mentioned this earlier from that distal vessel. I think it is very
important before you place the shunt in that you try to clear as much of
the thrombus as you can, proximal and distal, and then place that shunt
in and secure it either with a heavy silk tie or plastic vessel loops.</p>
<p>Most of those shunts you can listen with the Doppler and you will see
arterial flow in it. So you can listen on the surface of the plastic
shunt with a little water or acoustic gel and hear the arterial flow in
those shunts.</p>
<p><strong>For our military docs out there, if they’re deploying to a role and
their supply seargent calls them and asks what kind of shunts do you
want us to have — what sizes and what types? What recommendations
would you give to make sure that you have them on hand?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it’s a great question for now and it’s a challenge for us in the
future. I think here and now, I would try to really make sure that the
surgeon put his or her hands on Argyle shunts. The Argyle shunts come
four in a container, there’s a 12 French, 14 French, 10 French, and an 8
French all sort of in the same container. And its important to make sure
he has those. As the larger 14 French Argyle can work on an iliac. So
that would be one, and another would be to look for a 14 French chest
tube. And I would say, “so these are my shunt options and I would need
to have these available.”</p>
<p>The other shunts, the Sundt and Javid shunts, are the other ones you
could ask for, but then you only have one size for those. And so those
and the thrombectomy catheters is what I would have. Because I think
it’s very difficult to do an effective arterial repair without the
ability to do the thrombectomy, proximal and distal, because you will be
repairing that segment into thrombosed vessel with thrombosed inflow and
thrombosed outflow.</p>
<p>I think you have to get that vascular repair kit, if you will, assembled
and communicated with your scrub team ahead of time, so as to include
the specifics of each item: specific heparin saline dose, shunts to be
used, SH needle and some of the smaller ones, and thrombectomy
catheters. It is important to go through that series of tools that you
may find yourself needing. Also, keep in mind, we don’t use pulmonary
artery catheters as much anymore, but they can be used as a thrombectomy
catheter in a pinch. And then those thrombectomy catheters can be used
as good proximal inflow control. You can insert a large thrombectomy
catheter proximal and inflate the balloon with a three-way stopcock and
that will afford you inflow control in a pinch as well.</p>
<p><strong>Say you’re having a patient transferred in from the role to to the
higher level of care. Do you recommend these patients be heparinized, if
able, when they have shunts whether arterial or venous</strong></p>
<p>If they can be, then yes, that’s tricky. As you can imagine. And it’s
sort of similar to can one use heparin for the arterial repair itself.
Uh, and, and that depends upon whether or not there are other. Injuries
a head injury or torso injury, massive soft tissue bleeding or injury in
those cases. Uh, you know, I would not shut those, but I would not put
those patients on heparin, uh, because you, you, you will cause
bleeding.</p>
<p>So our experience is that, uh, the temporary vascular shunts in the
proximal vessels, above the knee or elbow, those shunts will stay Paden
without heparin, uh, for, um, you know, four to six hours because
they’re high flow vessels and. Uh, I was once taught that the best
anticoagulant is flow.</p>
<p>If you have high flow in those larger proximal vessels, the shunts will
stay patent without heparin. The distal shunts, if they do clot off,
what we have found is that they don’t cause harm when they clot off. You
basically are just back to square one with the occluded vessel and you
have to do the thrombectomy, assessment, and repairs.</p>
<p>So even if the shunts do thrombose, our experience has been – at least
in the short term of the temporary shunts – that in two, four, five,
six hours they do not cause harm when they thrombose. You just have to
do the thrombectomy and assessment at that time.</p>
<p><strong>To close out iliac artery injuries, if you did need to ligate either
the common or external iliac artery due to severe injury, what kind of
options do you have there?</strong></p>
<p>Well, that all really depends on the patient and their overall
condition. If you have found yourself not being able to put a shunt in
and in that scenario you had to ligate the external iliac, that patients
is presumably in a really bad situation.</p>
<p>You can ligate it temporarily. So thinking that I am going to ligate it
and then get some help. But in 2-3 hours, I am going t o have to go back
and try to re-establish inline flow with another set of hands, with more
blood, a different surgeon, different lighting, different tools, because
leaving it ligated will incur a tremendous amount of ischemia into that
extremity.</p>
<p>There are the options of a cross femoral graft. I don’t think I have
ever done that in the setting of trauma, bringing a PTFE graft from the
other groin, the other femoral artery over to the injured femoral
artery. That would be extraordinary or unusual. But when the options are
just life over limb, and you have to just say: “I can’t repair it.” The
scenario, whatever the reason, does not allow me to establish inline
flow and the patient’s going to get an amputation and we are going to
work on saving his or her life, and move on.</p>
<p><strong>As we move our way down the leg, I want to stop and focus on the
common femoral and just discuss the principles of controlling the vessel
— the options and if ligation is an option at this level for any of
the branches? Also, in residency, we would talk about blast injuries and
accessing the common femoral to get hemorrhage control. Is this a common
maneuver performed in the combat trauma?</strong></p>
<p>The common femoral is not much less consequential than the iliac. In
fact, it’s probably every bit as consequential, as far as ligating it.
So it can be ligated as a damage control maneuver, but the consequences
will be significant if ligating the common femoral – just as
significant as the external iliac.</p>
<p>There’s three femoral arteries: the common, the deep femoral, and the
superficial femoral. I think similar to what I mentioned before, all
efforts should be maintained to try to maintain or establish flow
through those three, if at all possible, and balancing the situation at
hand, which sometimes means I have got to ligate it – because of the
flow of casualties, because of the capability I have at a given leve.
Again, ligation if its life over limb is still an important damage
control maneuver. You just have to be ready for the consequences of that
and move on.</p>
<p>So controlling it, I think the Fogarty catheters are useful to control
the deep femoral. Sometimes from the open common, you can insert a small
Fogarty down into the orifice of the deep femoral and inflate that
balloon and control back bleeding from the profunda. Often there are two
profunda femoris arteries. They are difficult to control as they are
right adjacent to the deep femoral vein. So, oftentimes controlling
those deep femoral vessels from the inside using the small Fogarties and
a three-way stopcock is quite handy. Then, the same tenets apply with
either placing a shunt and trying to do a primary repair or some sort of
interposition repair.</p>
<p><strong>The popliteal artery is an area that we frequently see injuries and
they can be quite difficult to manage. Can you discuss just a little bit
about how you best expose and set up the patient when you are trying to
access the popliteal artery, both above and below the knee.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I will. And I skipped a question there. You asked about accessing
the common for control. I think that’s acceptable, I mean, it just
depends on where the injury is and who is managing the case. I think if
it’s an individual who has done, 15 or 20 or 30 of these sorts of cases,
and they feel comfortable about accessing the common femoral to control
it – I don’t think there’s anything at all wrong with that. On the flip
side, if it’s a distal SFA (superficial femoral artery) injury or a
popliteal artery injury, in those situations, most of the time it should
not require just a virgin cut down on an uninjured common femoral.</p>
<p>Now for popliteal, I think it is really important to get in-flow control
to the popliteal. One has to expose the above knee popliteal artery,
which is really the distal segment of the superficial femoral artery as
it comes through the adductor magnus or Hunter’s canal.</p>
<p>You would start with a wide, long incision from above the knee to the
mid thigh. It is important to make sure to have a small sort of bump
with rolled towels that are placed underneath the calf, so that you prop
the leg up in a “frog leg position” and let gravity pull a lot of the
musculature of the leg down. Then, find the the distal superficial
femoral which is proximal to the above knee popliteal, just at or beyond
Hunter’s canal.</p>
<p>And now move the bump above the knee. Then, make a separate medial
incision below the knee, again using sort of gravity in a way to pull
the gastrocs and soleus down, so that you can open up that below knee
popliteal space – you are taking the muscles right down on the medial,
inferior edge of the tibia to open up that below the knee popliteal
space.</p>
<p>In this situation, you are going to need Weitlaner retractors.
Oftentimes, we have something called a popliteal retractor, which has
different depths of blades on the retractor. That’s also referred to as
a Henly popliteal retractor or Pilling retractor (must be the company
that makes it). Those are awfully handy because you may need varying
depths in blades, deeper than the standard Weitlaner retractor.</p>
<p>And then being able to really put a narrow handheld retractor, like an
appendiceal or a Wylie renal vein retractor, that allows you to really
retract. If you are above the knee and you are not that well exposed,
you can put that narrow handheld on the inferior aspect of the wound and
sort of toe in and really get down into the popliteal space itself.</p>
<p>If you are below the knee, you put that narrow handheld in the proximal
extent and again, toe in and you really can try to get that popliteal
space itself exposed. If you need to, you can join the above and below
knee incisions – sometimes with the trauma, the injuries are joined
anyway. Those are sort of some tenets.</p>
<p>Lastly, lighting. It can not be overstated how important lighting is,
sometimes that’s a luxury for those of you who are in a deployed
setting. But these are the top line things to think about with popliteal
artery exposure.</p>
<p>**From one of my own clinical experiences, especially in young
patients, with repairing or bypassing the popliteal artery, many times
these patients have very severe vasospasm at the end of the case. So
that, even though you may do a beautiful bypass, you have minimal
Doppler signals in the foot at the conclusion of the case. Have you
experienced this and do you have any thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. If the bypass has sort of an above knee-to-below knee
and you have excluded or ligated the injured popliteal artery, then
absolutely, a lot of times the patient will be relatively cold and in a
vasoconstrictive condition. As long as you feel like there’s flow in the
reverse vein bypass – ie: you can hear audible flow and it’s not a
water hammer signal, meaning that there’s some diastolic flow in the
arterial signal, and then there’s some sort of weak signal at the ankle
– most of the time, I will just be done, warm the patient up, and
resuscitate them. If any of those things are not true, you don’t have
any arterial signal in the graft, or if you do and it’s only a water
hammer signal, or where there’s no signal at all at the foot or beyond
the graft – then, you have to open it up. Pass thrombectomy catheters,
proximal and distal, and get that regional heparinized saline, and
really make sure that there’s not a real problem. But, that’s really a
judgment call and it is anxiety-provoking for sure.</p>
<p>But you have to have faith. I do think that if you feel like technically
you saw all of your stitches, you felt it was good, you had some good
outflow back bleeding before you did the distal, you didn’t forget to
the thrombectomy proximally, and you have signals – even if they are in
spasm and you feel it’s not as good as it should be – in some of those
cases, you warm the patient up and resuscitate them and the signal will
improve.</p>
<p>You can also do an on-the-table arteriogram, but that puts you in an
austere location and can be a little bit of going down a rabbit hole.
You will see the spasm and then say: “well, geez, now i need to
intervene on the spasm.” An on-table arteriogram is certainly an option
and it should not be discounted, but I also would encourage folks that
as long as those things are true – you saw your anastomosis, you
thrombectomized proximally and distally, you feel good about your
inflow/outflow, you have an arterial signal that has got some diastolic
flow (not water hammer in the graft), and you have some signal beyond it
– warm up the patient and see how they do.</p>
<p><strong>As we continue down the leg, we encounter our tibial vessels. How do
you decide on repairing tibial vessels versus just ligating them?</strong></p>
<p>So there’s a great paper I would refer you and your listeners to that
was published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery in 2010 with Gabriel
Burkhardt as the lead author.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-burkhardt2010" role="doc-biblioref">495</a>]</sup></span> It was a review of the
U.S. military experience with the practice of selective tibial artery
repair. When you think about what that means, selective repair, it means
we repair some but not all tibial arteries. So how do you determine
which ones to repair? That was a good review article in the Journal of
Vascular Surgery that I think looked at maybe a hundred tibial artery
injuries. What we found from that experience was some principles of
selective repair which led us fix those patients in which all three
tibial arteries were injured. This means that it was not just the
posterior tibial artery, but because of the injury pattern, the peroneal
and anterior tibial had also been severed and there was just no flow in
the foot. So in those situations, we did repair them with a reverse
saphenous vein graft. That’s the exception. Majority of times, as you
are alluding to and in that case series, we did not repair them because
we could ligate the single tibial artery injury since there was
redundant arterial flow to the foot. So you can ligate it, listen on the
table, and if the other tibial vessels are patent then it can remain
ligated and should remain ligated because tibial artery repairs are even
more technically challenging and time-consuming.</p>
<p><strong>We are going to shift our focus to cover venous injuries. What are
your thoughts? We have been talking a lot about the possibilities of
ligating arterial injuries. How do you approach venous injuries and
ligation?</strong></p>
<p>This would also fall under the descriptor of selective repair, which
means you repair some but not all. Without going into too much detail,
it depends. In almost all of the upper extremity veins, can and just
should be ligated. There is not enough muscle mass and flow in the upper
extremity veins to bother with repair. The exceptions might be a
proximal axillary vein or subclavian vein. But, by and large, the distal
axillary, brachial, basilic, cephalic veins can be ligated. In the lower
extremity, similarly, the small tibial veins can and should be ligated
– there should be no attempt to repair those. Coming proximally in the
lower extremity, popliteal and then the femoral vein, if the patient is
physiologically stable and performing a repair is possible or placing a
venous shunt (we have had good luck venous shunts staying patent), then
we have deferred to fixing the veins in those cases. If the patient is
not in profound shock and if the expertise is there and present to do it
with operating time, I think there is benefit to fixing those veins.
There have been studies that confirm that this approach affords better
arterial flow in the arterial repair because the venous outflow is not
impeded.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-rasmussen2022" role="doc-biblioref">492</a>,<a href="#ref-quan2008" role="doc-biblioref">496</a>,<a href="#ref-clouse2007" role="doc-biblioref">497</a>]</sup></span> Even if those veins
thrombose over time, they do it slowly and do not lead to pulmonary
emboli. So, when we can, we will fix those veins in the popliteal and
femoral segments. Conversely, if the capability does not exist, the
surgeon is not accustomed to repair, the patient is not doing well
physiologically, or there’s the need for the operating table – then you
just have to ligate those. I think ligating those veins in the popliteal
or femoral segment are also acceptable as a damage control maneuver.</p>
<p><strong>We could not finish a peripheral vascular trauma talk without
discussing fasciotomies. What are your advice for listeners regarding
fasciotomies?</strong></p>
<p>In the military setting, we have been liberal about the performance of
two incision-four compartment-lower extremity fasciotomy. I think they
should be done more liberally in our setting in the military. We
advocate for them and have shown that they can be done without
substantial additional morbidity and mortality. In fact, waiting to do a
fasciotomy or missing a fasciotomy has been shown to be associated with
mortality from early data from the wars. So part of that is in our
system, we often are going to lose track of these patients. We will see
them at a Role II, and then we would like to think, they don’t need the
fasciotomy at the Role II because they will do it at the Role III. And
then we are not going to do it the Role III, because they can do it in
the Role IV. But again, we are going to be evacuating these patients at
altitude and they are going to go out of our care. So I err on the side
of prophylactic, two incision-four compartment fasciotomy in the setting
of lower extremity vascular injury certainly with wartime vascular
injuries.</p>

<p><strong>We are going to skip the preoperative workup and description of
anatomy and zones of abdominal vascular trauma, so please review this on
your own. As a side note, we are also going to skip the management of
iliac artery injuries as we covered that as part of our peripheral
vascular trauma session.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are going to start with a scenario.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scenario: “You have a patient with a gunshot wound to the abdomen
general surgery has already prepped them from the neck to the knees and
performed a laparotomy from the xiphoid to the pubis They pack the
abdomen and temporarily have control what they said was pulsatile
bleeding from zone one can you take us through how to get supra celiac
control And in a case like this and in a trauma</strong></p>
<p>For a case like this, ust a couple of starter points. Should proceed
without you know close communication with the entirety of the
resuscitation team So I think if I was coming into a case like this or
participated in a case like this with you know with our team I would
start by making sure that I was on good terms with my anesthesia
colleagues that they knew what we were facing in this in this situation
that they were pursuing all the key tenants of damage control
resuscitation and and and all that That means meaning you know leading
with a blood product or whole blood resuscitation keeping the patient
warm and and all of those tenants So I would start with that and I think
as far as technically from a technical standpointin these types of
casesI will almost always you can’t so what you can’t see and I’ll I’ll
often really immediately assess my exposure I mean meaning the
laparotomy [00:03:00] So you mentioned thatLaparotomy in this case was
from the to the pubis And and and that’s a great start Butbut for the
approach that you have referenced is likely to be needed in this case um
I’ll often reset and actually come up a higher go between the and the
costal margin and almost begin you know two to three centimeters of Of a
of a sternotomy It’s not a sternotomy but it is at least coming along
the SciFest side of the xiphoid and really release thoracic the inferior
costal margins of the thoracic under the diaphragm so that she can
really pull the diaphragm I mean sorry the cost of margins laterally and
up so that you want to suspend your costal margins so that you’re almost
suspending the patient’s rib cage up in a way from the aorta and the
abdominal contents So I think making a good assessment of your exposure
initially really important Hopefullyyou know [00:04:00] in in in the
case that I am prepping and in an operate on these cases I’ll try as
best I can to use a retractor Such as thethat will allow for retractors
to really be placed up underneath the costal margin So again you can
spread spread those costs origins and try to lift the thoracic almost
lift the cost of margins away from the abdominal contents If if you
don’t have an Omni you can still make sure that you’re trying to OSE and
suspend thatum superior most aspect or cuddle Or cranium aspect of
yourof your exposure Once that’s done And the other part of
communicating with anesthesia is to see if they have a nasal gastric
tube downsuper celiaccontrol of or in this case is almost always
facilitated by having a nasal gastric tube in the esophagus to allow one
to two You know to pop esophagus umin this area and and then be able to
get around that esophagus circumferentially and sometimes place some
sort of [00:05:00] umbilical tape or sometimes a Penrose drain to allow
for apt left sided Retraction of the esophagus away from the the a
cruise that’s surrounding the aorta The other areas is really mobilizing
the left lateral segment of the liverso that that can either be brought
cephalad or tucked you know once it’s mobilized can be Tucked in in area
early and brought to the right side or the whole portion of the liver so
that you’ve got the left lateral segment out of the way And now at this
point you know one is left with the cruise that’s overlying the aorta
The other maneuver here sometimes dependent upon the situation is is put
into patient a little bit of reverse Trendelenburg to let the stomach
and and pull that stomach the inferiorally so that you create as big a
window as you can Oh with the esophagus retracted to the patient’s left
the stomach kind of pulled down Sometimes you can have a resident or a
an assistant put their hand on the [00:06:00] stomach and retract it
towards the pelvis if you will Sometimes a little bit of reverse T-Bird
helps with that and you can kind of hopefully picture this So now you’ve
got the separated you’ve really The cost of margin suspended and now
you’ve got a window in which you can work And and at this point now it’s
maneuvers dividing the skeletal muscle which is the cruise overline the
aorta This can often facilitated with a large right ankleyou know in a
Bovie extenderand you know in this case you know you can almost always
see that you’re dividing skeletal muscle over the aorta if there’s a
pulse hopefully there’s even a weak pulse you know one can feel the
aorta and just divide the cruise over the aorta and and try to do some
blood dissection on either side to allow your patient of the spineOn
either side you know in these cases I typically don’t try to spend time
getting circumferential control of the aorta It’s not like an elective
aneurysm control So or elect bang chrism [00:07:00] repair where we’ll
sometimes get round the entire order and these cases if you can get on
their side of the aorta down fineyou know that that is is is what is
needed and and is most efficient in these emergent sort of cases So up
there if you have other questions I mean it’s a it’s a unexposed which
requires you know a comprehensive set of of of things to think about But
I’ll I’ll</p>
<p>stop there for now</p>
<p>Do you have any</p>
<p>questions or comments</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> Somy question is sometimes you’re faced with a situation of
entering a patient sad them and obviously there’s a large rush of blood
and you think it may be coming from somewhere in the upper aorta Do you
think it’s worth taking the time to get super Celia and control in the
in the way that you described before doing a video this rotation and
exposing the order that way Or are there any scenarios in which you
should do a medial visceral rotation first before you do that So take us
through can you take us through a [00:08:00] medial visceral rotation
When did she to want to leave the kidney down when to take it off sort
of the falls and advantages of doing each of those approaches</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think so That’s a great question I think It is
worth getting super celiac control If in the scenario that you described
where where you you know the description is a zone one a hematoma that’s
bleedingandyou know you you’ve got some a little bit of time you know
somebody may be holding pressure or but I do think it’s worth getting
super celiac control if you think it’s from the zone one Now if it’s you
know the initial description was on one and then you get in there and
you look and it’s actually it looks to be from the spleen or or from a
different area then then you can readjust But if it’s truly a a a zone
one hematoma that’s got active bleeding then I to answer your question I
do think it’s worth taking the time to get super celiac controlthe
medial visceral rotation of courses [00:09:00] is designed to to to to
give upyou know optimal exposure to the left medial visceral rotation is
is designed to give optimal exposure of of the para visceral segment of
the aorta Sothat is you know the the the super celiac segment all the
way down to You know to the aortic bifurcation and and and and really
the left primarily the left iliac common iliac artery initially although
it can be taken across the ORIC bifurcation to see the right iliac as
well in this case that that is performed through dividing the white line
of told along the sigmoid sigmoid colon and the left colonand you know
establishing this plane and the retroperitoniumand and a good portion of
this is is steadyyou know blunt dissection it’s facilitated with Bovie
electrocautery But it it is also um you know there’s a plane in that in
this area that is developed with with with blood [00:10:00] to section
as well And in the setting of traumaalmost always this this detection
plane is taken from the sigmoid the left colon up to divide the the
attachments and grained the spleen and and the left kidney all the way
to the to the midline and then to the patient’s right ultimatelyand I
think in in the setting of trauma the kidney is Almost always brought up
into this and and and just bring the kidney up I think it’s generally
easier It’s a little bit faster because you don’t have to take the time
to to find that plane you know above the left kidney and to leave it
down in the setting of trauma Um I would almost always bring that left
kidney up</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Okay</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> if that’s yeah</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah I think that’s perfect one question I have is it seems
like the spleen is always getting in the way and always bleeding at the
end of one of these rotations Do you have any tips for managing bleeding
from the spleen</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well I think thisgoes back to I think my initial comments
and and probably one of the key tenants of of this type of a procedure
is exposure and making sure that if you’re going to undertake this that
you’ve really Gotcha Retractor you’ve got your incision up along the
alongside not just to the XY FOI but along side the XY Floyd and the
cost of margin so that you can really bring that the left cost of margin
both of them and suspend it up Because I think and in many cases what
you described is a result of just not being able to see welland soyou
know I think the the best I would the best tip I could give is is to
really try to make sure that that your exposure is as best you can and
if you’re compromising on exposure um you knowwhich which is easier said
than done I I understand that But if you feel like you’re compromising
on exposure or retraction that is that that’s I think a contributor</p>
<p>to to</p>
<p>to splenic</p>
<p>injury</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I have a question Speaking of exposure specifically about
eviscerating the battle I find myself as the as the senior residents
sometimes appreciating actually having difficult and nuances to do this
The way that I’ve learned to do it is kind of taking all the bowel and
finding a lap pad large [00:11:00] enough that’s moist I’m placing some
sort of clamp or something around it and then having someone hold it
outside the abdomen but I’ve always found that it sort of ends up being
clunky or the bowel falls out of the time Do you have any tips on how to
eviscerate and control the small balance situation like this</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> That’s a great question And it is it’s it is very
difficult to describe this using in a discussion It’s one of those
things where you just got to feel it But in my experience this is the
and I hope those who are listening and you can kind of picture yourself
in the situation This is really the the the the main Purview and job of
the surgeon that’s on the patients right So you can picture in a you’re
on the patient’s rights and and it takes a it takes ait takes a strong
and and I think big I don’t necessarily mean physical but it takes a
strong and a big right hand to get that bowelthatyou know Often and over
[00:12:00] and to the patient’s right side you’re you know you’re
pulling it from the left to the right And and I you know I’m sitting
here to describing it and my hand is I’m trying to extend my hand as
wide as I can you know and and it’s it’s not a subtle move It’s notit it
shouldn’t be a rugged but it needs to be very it can’t be done with a
gentle it’s Until a type of thing you’ve gotta be strong with it And I
don’t use in this situation I’ll get operative towels I’ll ask them to
moisten blue towel or wet blue towel And you know basically what you do
is with you know with your left hand as you take that blue towel and you
put it underneath your right hand which has the viscera in it and you
know you sort of You tried to get it down at the base so that you really
that blue towel here and your right fingers are coming across the aorta
you knowcause you’re taking it from the you know from the patient’s left
to the patients to the midline and then [00:13:00] try to get it over to
the right and then put this big blue towel this wide blue towelyou know
underneath your fingers and then you know lay it out and and then
hopefully I mean this is where I I actually like in my situation or in
my preferences to use the Omni but you’re going to need big a wide you
know retractor that’s going to take the place of your right hand That’s
going to now come in on the top of that blue towel And and hold all of
that and maybe a couple that hold that visceral you know to the patient
to the right of</p>
<p>the patient’s Midland</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> That’s one of those maneuvers that I feel like is very much
easier said than them and I’ve been</p>
<p>humbled by it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> it’s very difficult to describe</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I want to just ask a follow up question about the middle of
the medial visceral rotation that I asked her My question just to
clarify question is is there ever a situation in which you’re faced with
a bleeding error where because of the time it takes to get super sealing
I control that you would rather do a visceral rotation and be controlled
being on it that way Or is your approach always Basically without fail
too if you have a high aortic injury to get your con control and then
immediately rotate the viscera and expose the order that way Secondly</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well I think there’sgreat question I mean I think that if
youthere there are scenarios where if you if you If you feel like you
know you see the bleeding let’s sayyou know it’s zone one and all of a
sudden you you know you’re getting ready to do this and you see that it
is a spurter from the SMA you know a superior mesenteric artery and it
doesn’t look like it’s the aorta for example And because there’s some
structures of course in zone one that aren’t I mean obviously they’re
not some are not the aorta So I think that the scenario that you
wouldforego super celiac control would be a scenario in which you you
made an observation that you felt like you saw the bleeding It wasn’t
necessarily from the aorta and you felt like you could kind of get it
controlled Locally you know without having to occlude a inflow from the
aorta So but thatif it’s unknown you know and you have the you had just
you don’t know where it’s coming from in zone one I think short of that
I wouldadvocate for trying to get a super celiac control</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Greatso when we talked to the left medial this rotation for
our kind of med students out there we’re we’re thinking that there’s
likely an aortic injury or a a a branch close off the aorta Um sometimes
you’ll need to do a right medial visceral rotation thoughand that’s
generally when you’re kind of worried about eithergenerally a [00:14:00]
IVC injuryso Dr said can you just take us through a few of the nuances
of a right medial Chris rotation</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So this isyou know this from obviously from the
other side and this involves dividing the the White line of tollstarting
often at the and the coming along the right colon and bringing theyou
know the Sikh cephalad and and and the entire right colon you know to
the patient’s left now and then cephalad it’s I’m surprised most of the
time in these cases it’s actually Not so much a rotation to the mid line
and then the left as it is bringing everything up cephalad to almost to
the patient’s left costal margin for example They really are almost
bringing the CQM and the and the right colonYou know to the up onto the
patient’s left chest in a way and and this is a plane that also similar
to the medial visceral rotation on the left [00:15:00] side This is a
plane that is largely developed with blunt dissection It’s a combination
Once the the The parent Niamh retroperitoneum has been opened with with
some Bovie electrocautery than than the plane should develop And in this
case you’ll see almost immediately the the left iliac vein and then the
vena cava And and you continue to bring the the left colon up until you
see the the left renal vein or I’m sorry the right renal vein and and
the kidney AndAnd and you know it did it’s superior extent This willof
course expose the head of the pancreas the duodenum and the head of the
pancreas Andsimilarly um You know this the visitor in this situation I
get a a wet blue towel or operating towel I guess it can be white towel
but I don’t really like to use a lap sponge cause it’s too small and it
doesn’t quite have enough substance And you will one willyou know place
that that [00:16:00] Blue operative towel down along your fingers that
are bringing this this all of the vis are up so that you really get it
all partitioned away with with a substantive operative toweland that
that has to be then you know cold in with a large retractors so that
your hands are free to actually operate</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Perfect one thing I just want to remind some of our residents
in medicines out there is I I would really go onto YouTube after this
and just look up left and right middle vis rotation that’ll really help
solidify these points It’s one thing hearing it but I think if you watch
some videos on it I think it’ll really help bring it all togetherand if
you also want to</p>
<p>hear</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think I was going to say the same or to obviously
have an Atlas but are you know something because it’s it is you got to
kind of combine I think the word that we’re talking about here with with
some sort of visual aid the end the thing that I would recommend and
make a point is for those who have the opportunity to assist with spine
exposures So in these maneuvers that [00:17:00] we often perform as
assisting our orthopedic or neuro surgical colleagues to expose do
anterior exposure to the spine many of these maneuvers we’re talking
about are performed in the spine exposure which which sometimes can be
overlooked by trainees And and and even They sometimes is well that’s
not a very good operation You don’t really get to so and and it’s not
really a basket operation Boy I’ll tell ya Um high exposures are a great
way to begin to nerve or learn the tenants of of of rotating the
visceral either to the right to the left and exposing the
retroperitonium</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I think alsoprocurements have been extremely helpful for
liver and kidneythis right sided rotation Is it usually the first step
of any procurement And then you’re kind of seeing the entire intro part
IOM So it’s also a very good opportunity to learn some anatomy</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Absolutely And</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Great point</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong>we haven’t discussed the infer renal aorta yet [00:18:00] I
think probably a slightly more straightforward approach but can you
discuss your technique for inferiority exposure and then talk about I’m
kind of coming across the renal vein when you can like gate it how to
get it out of the way things like that</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So the the mostYou know the most common and maybe
most straightforward exposure is what we refer to as a you know
transperitoneal and from he’s a colleagueexposure of thethe infer renal
aorta you know this here again people who are listening and looking
either at a videos or oror an Atlas kind of recommend or recognize that
the infer music colleaguemeans that the transverse colon isreflected
cephalad andit’s one of the first moves is to really hold up the
transverse colon um in the patient’s abdomen and and drape it up You
know cephalad almost on the patient’s costal margin And often you
[00:19:00] know I’ll set initially set a retractor Now that also goes
into a big to me is is partitioned with a operative towel a moistened or
wet operative towel to get the transverse colon um and retracted
cephalad and then the next move is to divide the ligament of Treitzand
this to me is always also a maneuver that’s led by the surgeon on the
patient’s right Um whether that’s the primary surgeon and the the
attending or resident however you’re configured this this maneuver
dividing the ligament of Treitz and and getting the you know fourth
portion of the denim which is to the left of the midline in a dividing
that ligament of Treitz that peritoneum and and and bringing that over
to the patient’s right is is the next move Um and and that begins this
Process of you know getting really the the bowel Nowin this case the the
left colon is left remains to the patient’s left [00:20:00] but you’re
bringing all all bowel to the patient’s rightthis this is not a medial
visceral rotation of of the entirety of the viscera This is only
bringing the duodenum the fourth portion of the Dudina and all of the
small bowel Partitioning it to the patients Right And and this also
again if one can visualize this be done by the patient the surgeon to
the patient’s right and the right side of the patient bringing that
small bowel all the way across This also takes a wide and broad and
strong hand This can’t be done with I don’t know how else to say it It’s
just a broad and strong sort of maneuver with with the hand to bring
this across and then and then partition get another wet blue towel I
keep saying blue I guess it could be white but operative towel and Yeah
Put that towel over your fingers And you know as you bring the small
bowel over that’s the infer renal aortayou know this [00:21:00]
positioning Then retractors one will you know at the most cephalad
extent of that exposure begin to see the left renal veinat the at the
root of the of the colon mesenteryand you know at the at the caudal most
portion of this you’ll see the aortic bifurcation Um andyou know that’s
that’s sort of the extent of this Thethe the the left renal vein Mmm Hmm
Can be like if if it if it facilitates aorta control Um obviously if one
is going to locate the left renal vein it’s it’s optimal to leave thethe
branches of the left renal vein So the gonadal eh the the lumbar vein
which also often will drain the left kidney and then the the the gonadal
So if those are left intact dividing that left renal vein can usually be
accomplished without causing a significant detriment to the left kidneyI
will say that dividing the left renal vein is easier said than
[00:22:00] done I mean it’s it is you know it’s a thin wall structure
which of course can bleed significantly itself So you know these are all
Sort of decisions that have to be made depending upon what what Andrew
you’re dealing with and and the extent of your exposure</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong>I think one question I forgot to ask you earlier was I think
Infor renally they are it is a little bit easier to get around
completely input you know an umbilical tamper a vessel loop around But
like you mentioned earlier Super celiac area That’s a lot harder to do
when sometimes the goal is not to always do that but you have tips on
how to do that Because again I’d been humbled by that I’m in a
procurement one time when the attending allowed me to try and get around
it and I tried to bluntly with my fingers to get around the posterior
Huerta and had a lot of trouble So do you have any tips about that</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well I think this isI mean this is just takes um you know
experience and and and And and and time I mean I in my own mind as I see
this I I you know [00:23:00] this is a combination of sort of a little
bit of Metzenbaum scissors a little bit of kind of pushing you know
cause what you’re trying to do is to to to to free the aorta from from
the connective tissue around it to get back to the spine You know
sometimes actually almost always I’ll use a metallic Pediatric yang
cower That is sort of one of my the suction or dissection tools of
choice is is pediatric Yankauer which is small and profile It’s got a
blunt tip It will you know it is a suction device And so that’s
usefuland you know kind of this combination of pushing a little bit of
maths here and there Metzenbaum scissorsand and a little bit of feeling
with your finger so you can get that connective tissue aorta freed and
then you know you can begin one can begin toto you know use a right
angle a big right angle and and try to to you know to get underneath it
Obviously what you’re looking for here in [00:24:00] part is is a Is
lumbar you know you’re looking for the lumbar vessels which you know
those are the things you need to leave behind for at least by as we tell
our residents you know find the outside before you find the inside you
can find them outside before you find the inside of a lumbar Then you
can clip ityou know another I think very useful tool in this situation
is is having large Weck cliffs you know because you’re not it’s very
difficult to pass you know a silk to lie gate a lumbar And in these
situations a lot of times you know you need those large WEC medium to
large Weck clips to help you know get on either side of a of a lumbar
artery or vein</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great one quick point back to their renal vein I kind of
picked this up just as fast past week is you can really get a lot of
mobilization on the renal vein just by ligating some of the smaller
branchesout distantly on it not even the gonadal but sometimes the
adrenal vein and a few of those veins And you can really get you know
five centimeters a [00:25:00] mobilization of that renal vein which
should give you enough distance to clamp Um But now we’re going to go
intoeach vessel off the aorta I know this isn’t exactly what you’re
going to see in a trauma You don’t have isolated celiac artery injury or
isolated SMA injury but just for the sake of learning we’re going to
talk through each vessel and talk about the options of exposing it and
then repairing it So starting approximately a Dr. Rasmussencan you
discuss what the best ways to see the celiac artery are andany options
for repairing it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah So the you know the celiac arteryI guess the origin
of the celiac arterycan be seen either through the lesser SAC this is
again through you know an an sort of a I guess an anterior approach<br />
through the stackand this is would likely be very similar to the
exposure we talked about with a super celiac aortic exposure where the
cause retracted you know caudally down towards the pelvis[00:26:00] and
um You know that opening lesser sack and pulling the stomach down and
and sort of getting the pancreas to come down That will expose then the
the origin of the first centimeter to the celiac artery If the proximal
segment of the celiac artery is injured and bleeding then then the
repair optionsyou know I I think lend into the category of any vascular
know major vascular three If it can be prepared repaired primarily then
you know using<br />
four Oh five Oh proline future If it does a grazing wound and repairing
it primarily can be done then then that’s that’s one option if it’s a
largeyou know<br />
celiac artery injury that that cannot be repaired primarily and there’s
destruction of the wall Oftentimes you’re an individuals in a dam Really
a damage control situation there And repair is not so much Your first a
lot of thought You’re [00:27:00] really situation trying to just control
bleeding and save patient’s life And and so in those cases you know
controlling the celiac artery and even consider you know ligating it may
be necessaryyou know as a damage control maneuver at least initiallythe
other way to see the origin of the celiac artery is still left medial
visceral rotation So the maneuver we described before will show the
entire we’ll expose the the para visceral segment of the aorta</p>
<p>um to include the first centimeter to the celiac artery</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> so any keys to identifying the common hepatic artery and
againthoughts on ligation strategies and repairs</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So I think the you know I think I mean the common a
paddock you’ll need to that will not be able to be visualized through
the left medial visceral rotation that the common hepatic and getting
out into the [00:28:00] segments there of of the of the the major
branches of the celiac one we’ll need then in that case to be coming
from a you know a transparent to Neal you know anterior approach with a
lesser SAC And you know di identifying the common a paddockyou know is
isMmm You know requires sort of a recognition of where the celiac artery
is You’re in the lesser SAC The stomach really has to be Ah inferiorly
This is again if you find yourself operating in this space you know the
the the costal margins as I said to begin really have to be flared And
almost suspended upso that you’ve really opened this Sometimes reverse
Trendelenburg is useful getting a hand a resident or a med student’s
hand to pull the stomach downand open up that that that spaceum it you
know that that will then should expose then the you know the the the
second and third segments of the celiac and its major branches to
include the common [00:29:00] hepatic artery</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great And so as far as like getting the common hepatic artery
how does the GDA play into this And by that I mean the gastroduodenal
artery</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> I mean you know the the the the GDA is as I guess is most
commonly the case is you know and and listeners know is Really one of
the first or the first branch of the common hepatic artery and and
really defines the junction between the common hepatic and proper
paddock arteriesand I thinkI mean ideally um The common hepatic should
should not ideally you don’t want to legging any of these arteries right
So I think that we start with that premise to say geez if we can get a
repair done that’s going to be our that’s going to beoption awhether
that’s the common hepatic proper paddock or GDA just like any artery in
the body like 18 it may be required as it is a damage control maneuver
just to control hemorrhage [00:30:00] let the patient recover a little
bit talk to anesthesia and sort of see how things are going Make an
assessment of of of the region distal to where you’ve liked it So so
this is just a basic tenant of like aiding any artery in a damage
control situation we recognize no matter which artery rely gating the
consequences of that ligation or we need to assess those consequences
and then and then address them if we’re able if patients you know able
to um to move to the next step Soobviously liking the comment of paddock
distal to the GDA likely to Render you know a significant portion of the
of the duodenum the pancreas and and then the liver is schemicand so you
know if the light station can occur proximal if the injury is proximal
to the GDA um then you know that would and G and perfusion can be
maintained into the GDA then that’s that’s preferable[00:31:00]but if I
was in one of these situations or when I am And we find ourselves having
to like ate it or we like hated it We didn’t quite know cause we didn’t
but we had to you know I was bleeding and there was a clip when we had a
damage control overand now Jeannie or the common paddock or the proper
paddocks lie dated Now what I usually will talk to anesthesia We’ll get
the patient as resuscitate as we can We’ll get out the Doppler we’ll
make an assessment because you know dependent upon patients can tolerate
but depending on the resuscitation status collateral where your legation
isyou know they may be able to tolerate having any one of those vessels
legged If on the other hand without your Doppler and you get the patient
resuscitate as possible and there’s clear aschemia then you’re going to
be faced with the decision whether or not we need a reconstruct the this
leg vessel shuntedor you know it may be situation where you have to deal
with the metabolic consequences and leave the [00:32:00] leave at like
eight There’s not one answer You know that I think there’s a there’s not
one answer that applies to all situations It’s a I think it’s a learning
and adhering to the principles of damage control resuscitation and
damage control surgery</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Absolutelyso off the record dr real quick I think you miss
said the distal and proximal cause you can lie gate the you can like it
The common a paddock Proximal to the GDA because you’ll have retrograde
flow from the GDA into the proper hepatic Rightcould you just say that
sentence and one more time and then</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Sure what I guess what I’m what I’m meant to say And I
don’t you know actually looking at a diagram so I can try to see the so
what I meant to say is that you can often lie gait the common hepatic
proximal GDA keeping a retrograde filling into the GDA and maintaining a
viability of the Dudina and the pancreatic head</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Perfect Thank you Okay And now let’s dive into the Um and
this is you know very close in proximity to the celiac artery So many of
the options to visualize it will be the same but there’s some unique
differences A is with its relationship with the pancreas Um so briefly
doctor asked me Jason what are our options to see the SMA and and and do
we kind of think of SMA kind of in portions a little differently than
some</p>
<p>other vessels</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Definitely So the the SMAyou know the the the pathway
really to see the first centimeter to the SMA superior mesenteric artery
is is through the left medial visceral rotation which will which will
show the entire pair visceral segment of the order including [00:33:00]
for centimeter two of the superior mesenteric artery If If more exposure
needs to be um you know if if one is trying to expose more distal
segments of the SFA then one probably have to go back to the anterior
approach not the left mijo visceral rotation and go through the approach
And in this case then the the superior mesic Terrick artery is of course
closely related to the head of the pancreas And and and and and so in
this situation that the head of the pancreas Well it needs to be you
knowdivided or you know the the SMA is closely adherent to the head of
the pancreas in this case distal of the segment of the superior
mesenteric artery distal to the pancreas is often now best seen in an
infra And these a call like approach And this this is the superior
mesenteric artery exits the second segment and its relation with the
[00:34:00] pancreas and comes out into the the root of the mesentery and
into the into the the small bowel This is where for example Mmm Mmm One
with lift the transverse colon cephalad as we described beforeand and
retract the small bowel to the patient’s right and see the the the root
of the SMA below and and inferior to the to the transverse colon So yes
there there are these stink segments of the superior mesenteric
arteryexpose Each of those segments um has a little bit of a different
anatomic approach And and then and each of those segments hasyou know I
think considerations that are important that relate to surrounding
structures you know whether that’s the obviously the pancreas the root
of the transfers colon</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> thank you for taking us through those complicated anatomy of
the SMA as it kind of traverses the abdomenyou know in [00:35:00] all of
these vessels obviously we you know primary repair is kind of our our
our first option if possible And then many times you may need to
interposition graftJust you know I know this is a question that is very
case dependent is there a portion of the SMA that you can lie gate and
or is a is SMA just a no</p>
<p>ligation zone throughout</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well that’s a great question AndI think similar to other
other large axial vessels or arteriesyou know the more distal segments
is just going to be better tolerated than like eating the you know the
proximal proximal segments So um You know I would not say it’s a no
ligation zone in its throughout its entiretybut I do thinkyou know that
if possibleefforts should be maintained or efforts should be undertaken
to maintain flow through the SMA through you know through through its
entiretyand you know repairing the SMA [00:36:00] just it depends upon
the injuryif it is a small grazing Wound Then then you know perhaps a
primary repair can be undertaken with a FORO or a five O proline
sutureum if it’s a more substantial wound um and and one can get it
controlledand and isolate it you know than than repair can be Um
Undertaken with a patchy angioplasty or even an interposition graft
That’s pretty rare And because those wounds are just so mortal um it’s
very different You know patients who have those sorts of axial injuries
at the proximal portions of these message check vessels typically don’t
surviveum And so you know it’s very difficult I I can’t think of a time
when I’ve necessarily been repairing for trauma the proximal segment or
two of of the SMA it’s a little bit different for an elective tumor
resection atherosclerotic occlusive disease and such But for
trauma[00:37:00] Um you know it’s it’s it’s pretty uncommon to be doing
extensive repair of of these SMA segments I don’t I don’t know what your
experience is or our thoughts are on that</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I certainly have had zero experience preparing SMA injuries
Um but</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think it’s just pretty uncommon</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong>I know that like you said in her position grafting is probably
more theoretical than realistic in a situation like this But can you
talk about the technique for it Maybe it may be useful for other types
of situations but what what what material are you using where you’re
where you’re bringing the graph from and how you tunnel it</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I was just going to say I think you guys are exactly right
And and and Adam and I both experienced this is yeah many times we’re
not seeing traumas with these injuries but many times we’re getting
called by the surgical oncologist with a kind of can’t cancer injury to
these vessels And so I think when we’re discussing SMA we can kind of
keep it in the perspective of how do we replace it if we need to Um and
in the situation where they need to do some larger sections So with that
in mind a doctor asked [00:38:00] can W can you tell us how you would
bypass it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah So I think that theI think that in these cases you
know and as I said in a rare situation in the setting of trauma if
you’ve if you’ve or able to establish proximal and distal control and
side-branch control of this segment and then you know your options for
reconstructing it um with an interposition graftyou know would would
include using a prosthetic like PTFE or Dacron or an autologous tissue
like vein And here it it just it depends it depends on how prepared you
know you are with the with patient for example as a patient prepped
where the one could harvest either the very proximal segment of greater
saffron is Fein or or a segment of deep femoral vein which which
mayactuallyYou know have a better size match to the proximal portions of
the SMA Um and and if that’s the [00:39:00] case you know if there’s
Interra contamination either from a tumor resection or from an injury
than it is preferable of course to to use autologous conduit such as
deep vein deep femoral vein a small segment of deep femoral vein or if
the if the saphenous at its proximal extent is It’s large enough you can
one can use thatif that’s not possible for example the leg isn’t prepped
or or the expertise that is not available to to harvest the deep vein
then I think using a small segment of rifampin soaked Dacron graft would
be probably what I would useand you know you get some rifampin from the
pharmacy you get a probably a six or eight millimeter Diameter a segment
of Dacron and that’s your inner position graph as far as tunneling it
that and and and how to route it That sort of depends upon the
injuryobviously the the the proximal most segments of The [00:40:00] SMA
are you know right underneath the pancreasif if this involves for
example a Whipple procedure where the head of the pancreas has got to
come out and and and with that approximal portion of the SMA then um you
know then then that’s probably gonna require a six or eight millimeter
diameter interposition graft you know to replace that And And if it’s
more distal and the SMA and now it’s you know in the infra means a colic
The transverse colon is off and you’re and they end up in the injury or
the the segment is is for examplebelowthe the the transverse colon and
that’s going to be you know three or four millimeters and it may be
there that vein you know sadness pain would would work or in some of
those cases a patch angioplasty using vein is actually</p>
<p>easier and better than than trying to do an interposition graft to sort
of debris the the injury and then and then do a patch angioplasty using
a segment of a saphenous vein</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> All right One follow up questionin these situations with SMA
[00:41:00] injuries so you were a parent and the bowel doesn’t look
infarcted or threatened at the time Do you think it’s mandatory to leave
these patients open and do a second look even if everything is fine on
the first timedo you think you can kind of take it on a case by case
basis</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think and I think you’re getting at a a an
important point here which is one we’ve emphasized throughout our
discussion is that none of these these procedures these these techniques
that we’re describing take place in isolation right They they they have
to be in conjunction with anesthesia and an assessment of the patient’s
physiology And And the whole team including the intensive care unit team
et cetera So it’s a really good pointMy own preference in these
situations is to leave the leave the abdomen open with a temporary
abdominal closure of some sort and plan a look Um you know 24 to 36
hours later I I really That I thinkit I think we know that the morbidity
of [00:42:00] of that approach is is very low I suspectyou know um I
think it probably provides not just reassurance but probably some real
advantages in case the the the perfusion actually is not adequate and
the patient becomes acidemic and the bowel is compromised you know
subsequent to To a pure initial departure from the or</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great And just to breeze through the inferior mesenteric
artery would you agree that you can generally like gate this with
impunity if it’s damaged in a trauma</p>
<p>situation</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong>I think never say like eight with impunitybut I because
there’s always situations whereYou know I think it has to be thoughtful
a ligation and in this case yes I think the majority of times the the
inferior mesenteric artery can be ligatedI think the thoughtful approach
here is to make an assessment as of to the patency of the iliac vessels
and specifically the internal iliac vessels I think if What we’re
[00:43:00] describing which is ligation of the inferior mesenteric
artery one can be more assured that that’s going to be tolerated if both
internal iliac arteries are patent for exampleif the SMA is paid and the
celiac is paid and then then the inferior mesenteric artery is almost
always tolerated Um if for some If it’s an aged person who’s got
occluded internal iliacs or they’ve got atherosclerosis lucid disease
and their mesenteries are not good then I think you have to be a little
worried about ligating the Ima in some cases</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Right And just for residents that’ll be rounding I think we
generally discuss when talking about the Ima and you know open aorta
situations if it’s occluded Or it’s pulsatile then we feel comfortable
like eating it It’s when it has that kind of a slight dribble back that
we may consider re implanting itjust to kind of prepare you for your
roundsdr SPC and we’re going to jump into the last vessel of branches
[00:44:00] of the aorta Not an easy one to discuss either we’re going to
get the renal arteriesandYou know I I know it differs kind of whether
it’s proximal or distal it very much as far as your exposurebut how how
do you think of the renal arteries in your management of them in a
traumatic situations</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> think that it’sI think that what I’m thinking about in
that question isIs similar these other vessels that thatand and
hopefully it’s helpful as a broad principle and an approach you knowwe
started this discussion talking about exposure and making sure
communicate with anesthesia and you know having the right suction
devices and retracting devices and headlights in these broad concepts to
make sure that you you’ve thought about um going into these casesyou
know I think um when it comes to the renal arteries like like all these
festivals um it’s useful to think well I’m either in a in a fairly
elective situation you know meaning I’ve got things under control for
the moment Patient’s physiology is a [00:45:00] solid um you know
there’s there’s whatever bleeding there is is controlled and I I’ve got
a reasonable exposure in contrast toI am in a uncontrolled situation and
there’s the patients in a in a really bad situationyou know the bleeding
is not controlled I don’t know where the bleeding is coming from et
cetera And I think because it helps one toHave a mindset about whether
I’m pursuing damage control surgery you know am I going to have to how
how much am I going to work to maintain a patency of this vessel or am I
going to be more tolerant of litigating it and just as a damage
controlman over and having to deal with the consequences but recognizing
I need to do it to say the patient’s life So the renal arteries are like
that I think because it is similar to the SMA it is pretty unlikely in
the setting of trauma to be reconstructing a renal artery I think that’s
pretty rare in trauma that the kidney the renal artery is
either[00:46:00] Not injuredyou know not injured And you know there’s
there’s hematoma that is from the parenchyma of the kidney or
surrounding vessels or the renal artery is injured and Broncos you know
and and And if it’s certainly if it’s injured in thrombose by the time
you know an individual gets to it it’s probably too late The scheming
time or mosquito time to the kidney’s been too great and there’s not
going to be value of of of trying to reconstruct it in the setting of
trauma And so if it happens to be an in between and I say well let’s say
that a actually it is one of these cases where you know explore the The
the zone two hematoma and a is coming from a main renal arterythen you
know and there’s flow in it but it’s bleeding Then I think the
principles that we have described such as either primary repair four or
five Oh potentially probably in this case maybe a six O monofilament
sutures such as proline It would be useful if that appears to [00:47:00]
compromise the lumen andeither a patch angioplasty of that artery or you
know a bypass But again that is extremely rare in the setting of
traumayou know if it’s going to require more than than a primary
repairyou know it’s I think in my experience equally likely that you
know you’re going to beligating that vessel for damage control</p>
<p>Um but but it’s pretty rare to be doing a complex renal artery repair in
the setting of of trauma similar to the proximal SMA injuries for
example</p>
<p>It just pretty rare</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> right Can you talk to us about your emotions You’re dealing
with your renal hematomas whether they’re Penetrating or blind I know
the old adage of every penetrating renal hematoma should be explored and
blood one should not be explored unless they’re expanding May not be
true but can you kind of walk us through how you approached this</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So you know zone two this would be a you know zone
one or the central dominal hematomas and you know the rules that
[00:48:00] you’re alluding to or that you know almost all or all zone
one hematomas should be exploredZone two hematomas which are the kidneys
in the lateral gutters<br />
basicallyyou know the the the general rule is that if it’s a expanding
hematoma regardless if the mechanism is blunt or penetrating then those
hematomas Should be explored in zone two Um the general rule goes as
most of your listeners know if it’s a blunt injury and the zone two
hematoma is not expanding then that does not need to be exploredIn
contrast if it’s a zone to hematoma from a penetrating mechanism then
most of the time though than need to be explored even if the hematomas
is stable Those are the general rules that we we use to guide our
approach to zone two a retroperitoneal or zone to retroparotoneil
hematoma So I use those I think that’s those are pretty goodYou know I I
think there are times [00:49:00] when a blunt you know one finds
themselves in in in in the belly because there was a hemoperitoneum from
a another injury And and and and there is a blunt mechanism and there’s
a zone two hematoma I have explored those in the past And I think that
if I don’t think those guidelines are meant to be You know a dictums
that can never beadjusted for an individual case I’m not sure if that</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So one question I know a lot of times many of these cases we
don’t already have the laparotomy performed Um you know they’re in the
trauma Bay They get a CT scan and they they call and say there’s an
intimal flap There’s a fistula maybe a pseudo aneurysm and the renal
artery any kind of general principles for</p>
<p>some of these sort of</p>
<p>incidental findings</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> and I think that’s a that’s probably a so what you
described there is is the most obviously I guess the most common
scenario in which which which it’s a The CT finding you know right in or
just after the resuscitation room of a of a of a main [00:50:00] renal
artery injury branch renal artery injury or maybe you know parenchymal
injury to the kidneyand in those casesI think if the let’s say it’s the
intimal flap that you described If the intimal flap is Either not Mateen
and there’s perfusion in the kid on that CT scan for exampleand it does
not appear to be flow limiting then that can be observed some of those
like other blond arterial injury some of those will healif it is
amenable to an endovascular placement of a bare metal stent that Can be
used in some institutions to tack downor stabilize that detection Um and
that will be if if if you really feel like it is a flow limiting more
than 50% stenosis caused by that intimal flap the more distal branch
artery injuries can often also be managed with endovascular techniques
such as [00:51:00] coil embolization Replacement of an occlusive you
know hemostat coil or other deviceand I think coil embolizing or or or
treating those depends uponyou know how the patient is doing how much
blood they’re requiring how large the hematoma isand then what their
hemodynamics arebut I think for those reasons what we described five or
10 minutes ago um having to fix these main these these renal artery
injuries in the ORs pretty uncommon because they’ve either been
diagnosed and managedbased off CT with or without endo Endovascular
technologies and oftentimes the management of a renal artery injury If
you’re in the or exploring and expanding you know hematoma and one of
the zone twos is is going to be nephrectomy you know because it’s it’s
that major injury in which there’s just not there’s not the [00:52:00]
indication for</p>
<p>repair</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> all the ranches of the aorta from the diaphragm Down to the
renals and Ima And I want to thank you very very much for taking a
complex topic and it’s sort of convoluted in breaking it down from
technical steps to algorithms for exposure to how to repair I think this
was overall an excellent episode Well we haven’t touched on the
endovascular management of trauma which we’ll save for another
episodebut thank you so much for for a great discussion I for recipes</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> well I applaud you for tackling this topic is unruly you
know it both in the the anatomy the anatomic exposure operative exposure
and then the seemingly endless number of scenariosThat can be considered
for either observation repair or damage control ligation I mean it’s a
it’s a it’s a complex topic I would commend you for tackling it and I
hope that our discussion is is useful for for you and</p>
<p>and your listeners</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> [00:53:00] Definitely I think this gives people the the
groundwork to really make some safe decisionsone thing I want to mention
to our listeners if you click on our show notes or you go to audible
bleeding.com we’re going to have links to different YouTube videos that
will have breakdowns of many of these exposures so you can listen to
this and then go watch it later to really reinforce itso thank you dr
recipe set again for an extremely complex episode that you’re breaking
down onto a podcast</p>
<p>Thank you for listening to audible bleeding. This is part two of six of
our vascular trauma series with dr mucin. Be sure to tune in to hear the

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> [00:00:00] welcome back to another collaboration between
behind the knife and audible bleeding Today we’re going to be covering
vascular trauma with our host Dr. Todd Rasmussen I’m sorry with our
guest Dr. Todd Rasmussen Dr. Rasmussen is a Colonel the United States
air force and professor of surgery and Associate Dean of research at the
uniform services university of health sciences and an attending vascular
surgeon at Walter Reed national military medical center A couple of
weeks ago he helped us out with the peripheral vascular trauma and today
he’s going to take us through abdominal vascular trauma thank you dr
recipes for joining us again on this collaborative podcast</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> You bet Thank you for the opportunity and the
congratulations to you and your team on creating such a useful
information sharing venue So I’m pleased to be with you[00:01:00]</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Absolutelyand we also have a ad hum A muesli on the podcast
He’s a chief resident at Cornell and a one of the team members of
audible bleeding So welcome</p>
<p>Adam</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> Yeah Thanks I’m excited to be here for this one</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong>so for the sake of time we’re going to skip the preoperative
workup and description of anatomy and zones of abdominal vascular trauma
So please review this kind of on your own Um and just as a side note
we’re also going to skip the management of iliac artery injuries We
covered that as part of our peripheral vascular trauma talk It can fit
into abdominal vascular trauma but for the sake of time we’re going to
just jump into a true abdominal vascular trauma So we’re gonna start out
with a little scenario just to kind of get our feet wet hereso doctor
asks me it’s in a you have a patient with a gunshot wound to the abdomen
A general surgery has already prepped them from the neck to the knees
and performed a laparotomy from the xiphoid to the pubis They pack the
abdomen and temporarily have control on what they said was pulsatile
bleeding from zone one can you take us through how to get a super celiac
control And in a case like this and in a trauma</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Sureso I think you know I think for cases like this
[00:02:00] just a couple of starter pointsyou know no case like this
Should proceed without you know close communication with the entirety of
the resuscitation team So I think if I was coming into a case like this
or participated in a case like this with you know with our team I would
start by making surethat I was on good terms with my anesthesia
colleagues that they knew what we were um facing in this in this
situation that they were pursuing all the key tenants of damage control
resuscitation and and and all that That means meaning you know leading
with a blood product or whole blood resuscitation keeping the patient
warm and and all of those tenants So I would start with thatand I think
as far as technicallythe from a technical standpointin these types of
cases I will almost always you can’t so what you can’t see and I’ll I’ll
often really immediately assess my exposure I mean meaning the
laparotomy [00:03:00] So you mentioned thatLaparotomy in this case was
from the to the pubis And and and that’s a great start Butbut for the
approach that you have referenced is likely to be needed in this case um
I’ll often reset and actually come up a higher go between the and the
costal margin and almost begin you know two to three centimeters of Of a
of a sternotomy It’s not a sternotomy but it is at least coming along
the SciFest side of the xiphoid and really release thoracic the inferior
costal margins of the thoracic under the diaphragm so that she can
really pull the diaphragm I mean sorry the cost of margins laterally and
up so that you want to suspend your costal margins so that you’re almost
suspending the patient’s rib cage up in a way from the aorta and the
abdominal contents So I think making a good assessment of your exposure
initially really important Hopefullyyou know [00:04:00] in in in the
case that I am prepping and in an operate on these cases I’ll try as
best I can to use a retractor Such as thethat will allow for retractors
to really be placed up underneath the costal margin So again you can
spread spread those costs origins and try to lift the thoracic almost
lift the cost of margins away from the abdominal contents If if you
don’t have an Omni you can still make sure that you’re trying to OSE and
suspend thatum superior most aspect or cuddle Or cranium aspect of
yourof your exposure Once that’s done And the other part of
communicating with anesthesia is to see if they have a nasal gastric
tube downsuper celiaccontrol of or in this case is almost always
facilitated byhaving a nasal gastric tube in the esophagus to allow one
to two You know to pop esophagus umin this area and and then be able to
get around that esophagus circumferentially and sometimes place some
sort of [00:05:00] umbilical tape or sometimes a Penrose drain to allow
for apt left sided Retraction of the esophagus away from the the a
cruise that’s surrounding the aorta The other areas is really mobilizing
the left lateral segment of the liverso that that can either be brought
cephalad or tucked you know once it’s mobilized can be Tucked in in area
early and brought to the right side or the whole portion of the liver so
that you’ve got the left lateral segment out of the way And now at this
point you know one is left with the cruise that’s overlying the aorta
The other maneuver here sometimes dependent upon the situation is is put
into patient a little bit of reverse Trendelenburg to let the stomach
and and pull that stomach the inferiorally so that you create as big a
window as you can Oh with the esophagus retracted to the patient’s left
the stomach kind of pulled down Sometimes you can have a resident or a
an assistant put their hand on the [00:06:00] stomach and retract it
towards the pelvis if you will Sometimes a little bit of reverse T-Bird
helps with that and you can kind of hopefully picture this So now you’ve
got the separated you’ve really The cost of margin suspended and now
you’ve got a window in which you can work And and at this point now it’s
maneuvers dividing the skeletal muscle which is the cruise overline the
aorta This can often facilitated with a large right ankleyou know in a
Bovie extenderand you know in this case you know you can almost always
see that you’re dividing skeletal muscle over the aorta if there’s a
pulse hopefully there’s even a weak pulse you know one can feel the
aorta and just divide the cruise over the aorta and and try to do some
blood dissection on either side to allow your patient of the spineOn
either side you know in these cases I typically don’t try to spend time
getting circumferential control of the aorta It’s not like an elective
aneurysm control So or elect bang chrism [00:07:00] repair where we’ll
sometimes get round the entire order and these cases if you can get on
their side of the aorta down fineyou know that that is is is what is
needed and and is most efficient in these emergent sort of cases So up
there if you have other questions I mean it’s a it’s a unexposed which
requires you know a comprehensive set of of of things to think about But
I’ll I’ll</p>
<p>stop there for now</p>
<p>Do you have any</p>
<p>questions or comments</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> Somy question is sometimes you’re faced with a situation of
entering a patient sad them and obviously there’s a large rush of blood
and you think it may be coming from somewhere in the upper aorta Do you
think it’s worth taking the time to get super Celia and control in the
in the way that you described before doing a video this rotation and
exposing the order that way Or are there any scenarios in which you
should do a medial visceral rotation first before you do that So take us
through can you take us through a [00:08:00] medial visceral rotation
When did she to want to leave the kidney down when to take it off sort
of the falls and advantages of doing each of those approaches</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think so That’s a great question I think It is
worth getting super celiac control If in the scenario that you described
where where you you know the description is a zone one a hematoma that’s
bleedingandyou know you you’ve got some a little bit of time you know
somebody may be holding pressure or but I do think it’s worth getting
super celiac control if you think it’s from the zone one Now if it’s you
know the initial description was on one and then you get in there and
you look and it’s actually it looks to be from the spleen or or from a
different area then then you can readjust But if it’s truly a a a zone
one hematoma that’s got active bleeding then I to answer your question I
do think it’s worth taking the time to get super celiac controlthe
medial visceral rotation of courses [00:09:00] is designed to to to to
give upyou know optimal exposure to the left medial visceral rotation is
is designed to give optimal exposure of of the para visceral segment of
the aorta Sothat is you know the the the super celiac segment all the
way down to You know to the aortic bifurcation and and and and really
the left primarily the left iliac common iliac artery initially although
it can be taken across the ORIC bifurcation to see the right iliac as
well in this case that that is performed through dividing the white line
of told along the sigmoid sigmoid colon and the left colonand you know
establishing this plane and the retroperitoniumand and a good portion of
this is is steadyyou know blunt dissection it’s facilitated with Bovie
electrocautery But it it is also um you know there’s a plane in that in
this area that is developed with with with blood [00:10:00] to section
as well And in the setting of traumaalmost always this this detection
plane is taken from the sigmoid the left colon up to divide the the
attachments and grained the spleen and and the left kidney all the way
to the to the midline and then to the patient’s right ultimatelyand I
think in in the setting of trauma the kidney is Almost always brought up
into this and and and just bring the kidney up I think it’s generally
easier It’s a little bit faster because you don’t have to take the time
to to find that plane you know above the left kidney and to leave it
down in the setting of trauma Um I would almost always bring that left
kidney up</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Okay</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> if that’s yeah</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah I think that’s perfect one question I have is it seems
like the spleen is always getting in the way and always bleeding at the
end of one of these rotations Do you have any tips for managing bleeding
from the spleen</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well I think thisgoes back to I think my initial comments
and and probably one of the key tenants of of this type of a procedure
is exposure and making sure that if you’re going to undertake this that
you’ve really Gotcha Retractor you’ve got your incision up along the
alongside not just to the XY FOI but along side the XY Floyd and the
cost of margin so that you can really bring that the left cost of margin
both of them and suspend it up Because I think and in many cases what
you described is a result of just not being able to see welland soyou
know I think the the best I would the best tip I could give is is to
really try to make sure that that your exposure is as best you can and
if you’re compromising on exposure um you knowwhich which is easier said
than done I I understand that But if you feel like you’re compromising
on exposure or retraction that is that that’s I think a contributor</p>
<p>to to</p>
<p>to splenic</p>
<p>injury</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I have a question Speaking of exposure specifically about
eviscerating the battle I find myself as the as the senior residents
sometimes appreciating actually having difficult and nuances to do this
The way that I’ve learned to do it is kind of taking all the bowel and
finding a lap pad large [00:11:00] enough that’s moist I’m placing some
sort of clamp or something around it and then having someone hold it
outside the abdomen but I’ve always found that it sort of ends up being
clunky or the bowel falls out of the time Do you have any tips on how to
eviscerate and control the small balance situation like this</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> That’s a great question And it is it’s it is very
difficult to describe this using in a discussion It’s one of those
things where you just got to feel it But in my experience this is the
and I hope those who are listening and you can kind of picture yourself
in the situation This is really the the the the main Purview and job of
the surgeon that’s on the patients right So you can picture in a you’re
on the patient’s rights and and it takes a it takes ait takes a strong
and and I think big I don’t necessarily mean physical but it takes a
strong and a big right hand to get that bowelthatyou know Often and over
[00:12:00] and to the patient’s right side you’re you know you’re
pulling it from the left to the right And and I you know I’m sitting
here to describing it and my hand is I’m trying to extend my hand as
wide as I can you know and and it’s it’s not a subtle move It’s notit it
shouldn’t be a rugged but it needs to be very it can’t be done with a
gentle it’s Until a type of thing you’ve gotta be strong with it And I
don’t use in this situation I’ll get operative towels I’ll ask them to
moisten blue towel or wet blue towel And you know basically what you do
is with you know with your left hand as you take that blue towel and you
put it underneath your right hand which has the viscera in it and you
know you sort of You tried to get it down at the base so that you really
that blue towel here and your right fingers are coming across the aorta
you knowcause you’re taking it from the you know from the patient’s left
to the patients to the midline and then [00:13:00] try to get it over to
the right and then put this big blue towel this wide blue towelyou know
underneath your fingers and then you know lay it out and and then
hopefully I mean this is where I I actually like in my situation or in
my preferences to use the Omni but you’re going to need big a wide you
know retractor that’s going to take the place of your right hand That’s
going to now come in on the top of that blue towel And and hold all of
that and maybe a couple that hold that visceral you know to the patient
to the right of</p>
<p>the patient’s Midland</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> That’s one of those maneuvers that I feel like is very much
easier said than them and I’ve been</p>
<p>humbled by it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> it’s very difficult to describe</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I want to just ask a follow up question about the middle of
the medial visceral rotation that I asked her My question just to
clarify question is is there ever a situation in which you’re faced with
a bleeding error where because of the time it takes to get super sealing
I control that you would rather do a visceral rotation and be controlled
being on it that way Or is your approach always Basically without fail
too if you have a high aortic injury to get your con control and then
immediately rotate the viscera and expose the order that way Secondly</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well I think there’sgreat question I mean I think that if
youthere there are scenarios where if you if you If you feel like you
know you see the bleeding let’s sayyou know it’s zone one and all of a
sudden you you know you’re getting ready to do this and you see that it
is a spurter from the SMA you know a superior mesenteric artery and it
doesn’t look like it’s the aorta for example And because there’s some
structures of course in zone one that aren’t I mean obviously they’re
not some are not the aorta So I think that the scenario that you
wouldforego super celiac control would be a scenario in which you you
made an observation that you felt like you saw the bleeding It wasn’t
necessarily from the aorta and you felt like you could kind of get it
controlled Locally you know without having to occlude a inflow from the
aorta So but thatif it’s unknown you know and you have the you had just
you don’t know where it’s coming from in zone one I think short of that
I wouldadvocate for trying to get a super celiac control</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Greatso when we talked to the left medial this rotation for
our kind of med students out there we’re we’re thinking that there’s
likely an aortic injury or a a a branch close off the aorta Um sometimes
you’ll need to do a right medial visceral rotation thoughand that’s
generally when you’re kind of worried about eithergenerally a [00:14:00]
IVC injuryso Dr said can you just take us through a few of the nuances
of a right medial Chris rotation</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So this isyou know this from obviously from the
other side and this involves dividing the the White line of tollstarting
often at the and the coming along the right colon and bringing theyou
know the Sikh cephalad and and and the entire right colon you know to
the patient’s left now and then cephalad it’s I’m surprised most of the
time in these cases it’s actually Not so much a rotation to the mid line
and then the left as it is bringing everything up cephalad to almost to
the patient’s left costal margin for example They really are almost
bringing the CQM and the and the right colonYou know to the up onto the
patient’s left chest in a way and and this is a plane that also similar
to the medial visceral rotation on the left [00:15:00] side This is a
plane that is largely developed with blunt dissection It’s a combination
Once the the The parent Niamh retroperitoneum has been opened with with
some Bovie electrocautery than than the plane should develop And in this
case you’ll see almost immediately the the left iliac vein and then the
vena cava And and you continue to bring the the left colon up until you
see the the left renal vein or I’m sorry the right renal vein and and
the kidney AndAnd and you know it did it’s superior extent This willof
course expose the head of the pancreas the duodenum and the head of the
pancreas Andsimilarly um You know this the visitor in this situation I
get a a wet blue towel or operating towel I guess it can be white towel
but I don’t really like to use a lap sponge cause it’s too small and it
doesn’t quite have enough substance And you will one willyou know place
that that [00:16:00] Blue operative towel down along your fingers that
are bringing this this all of the vis are up so that you really get it
all partitioned away with with a substantive operative toweland that
that has to be then you know cold in with a large retractors so that
your hands are free to actually operate</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Perfect one thing I just want to remind some of our residents
in medicines out there is I I would really go onto YouTube after this
and just look up left and right middle vis rotation that’ll really help
solidify these points It’s one thing hearing it but I think if you watch
some videos on it I think it’ll really help bring it all togetherand if
you also want to</p>
<p>hear</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think I was going to say the same or to obviously
have an Atlas but are you know something because it’s it is you got to
kind of combine I think the word that we’re talking about here with with
some sort of visual aid the end the thing that I would recommend and
make a point is for those who have the opportunity to assist with spine
exposures So in these maneuvers that [00:17:00] we often perform as
assisting our orthopedic or neuro surgical colleagues to expose do
anterior exposure to the spine many of these maneuvers we’re talking
about are performed in the spine exposure which which sometimes can be
overlooked by trainees And and and even They sometimes is well that’s
not a very good operation You don’t really get to so and and it’s not
really a basket operation Boy I’ll tell ya Um high exposures are a great
way to begin to nerve or learn the tenants of of of rotating the
visceral either to the right to the left and exposing the
retroperitonium</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I think alsoprocurements have been extremely helpful for
liver and kidneythis right sided rotation Is it usually the first step
of any procurement And then you’re kind of seeing the entire intro part
IOM So it’s also a very good opportunity to learn some anatomy</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Absolutely And</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Great point</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong>we haven’t discussed the infer renal aorta yet [00:18:00] I
think probably a slightly more straightforward approach but can you
discuss your technique for inferiority exposure and then talk about I’m
kind of coming across the renal vein when you can like gate it how to
get it out of the way things like that</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So the the mostYou know the most common and maybe
most straightforward exposure is what we refer to as a you know
transperitoneal and from he’s a colleagueexposure of thethe infer renal
aorta you know this here again people who are listening and looking
either at a videos or oror an Atlas kind of recommend or recognize that
the infer music colleaguemeans that the transverse colon isreflected
cephalad andit’s one of the first moves is to really hold up the
transverse colon um in the patient’s abdomen and and drape it up You
know cephalad almost on the patient’s costal margin And often you
[00:19:00] know I’ll set initially set a retractor Now that also goes
into a big to me is is partitioned with a operative towel a moistened or
wet operative towel to get the transverse colon um and retracted
cephalad and then the next move is to divide the ligament of Treitzand
this to me is always also a maneuver that’s led by the surgeon on the
patient’s right Um whether that’s the primary surgeon and the the
attending or resident however you’re configured this this maneuver
dividing the ligament of Treitz and and getting the you know fourth
portion of the denim which is to the left of the midline in a dividing
that ligament of Treitz that peritoneum and and and bringing that over
to the patient’s right is is the next move Um and and that begins this
Process of you know getting really the the bowel Nowin this case the the
left colon is left remains to the patient’s left [00:20:00] but you’re
bringing all all bowel to the patient’s rightthis this is not a medial
visceral rotation of of the entirety of the viscera This is only
bringing the duodenum the fourth portion of the Dudina and all of the
small bowel Partitioning it to the patients Right And and this also
again if one can visualize this be done by the patient the surgeon to
the patient’s right and the right side of the patient bringing that
small bowel all the way across This also takes a wide and broad and
strong hand This can’t be done with I don’t know how else to say it It’s
just a broad and strong sort of maneuver with with the hand to bring
this across and then and then partition get another wet blue towel I
keep saying blue I guess it could be white but operative towel and Yeah
Put that towel over your fingers And you know as you bring the small
bowel over that’s the infer renal aortayou know this [00:21:00]
positioning Then retractors one will you know at the most cephalad
extent of that exposure begin to see the left renal veinat the at the
root of the of the colon mesenteryand you know at the at the caudal most
portion of this you’ll see the aortic bifurcation Um andyou know that’s
that’s sort of the extent of this Thethe the the left renal vein Mmm Hmm
Can be like if if it if it facilitates aorta control Um obviously if one
is going to locate the left renal vein it’s it’s optimal to leave thethe
branches of the left renal vein So the gonadal eh the the lumbar vein
which also often will drain the left kidney and then the the the gonadal
So if those are left intact dividing that left renal vein can usually be
accomplished without causing a significant detriment to the left kidneyI
will say that dividing the left renal vein is easier said than
[00:22:00] done I mean it’s it is you know it’s a thin wall structure
which of course can bleed significantly itself So you know these are all
Sort of decisions that have to be made depending upon what what Andrew
you’re dealing with and and the extent of your exposure</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong>I think one question I forgot to ask you earlier was I think
Infor renally they are it is a little bit easier to get around
completely input you know an umbilical tamper a vessel loop around But
like you mentioned earlier Super celiac area That’s a lot harder to do
when sometimes the goal is not to always do that but you have tips on
how to do that Because again I’d been humbled by that I’m in a
procurement one time when the attending allowed me to try and get around
it and I tried to bluntly with my fingers to get around the posterior
Huerta and had a lot of trouble So do you have any tips about that</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well I think this isI mean this is just takes um you know
experience and and and And and and time I mean I in my own mind as I see
this I I you know [00:23:00] this is a combination of sort of a little
bit of Metzenbaum scissors a little bit of kind of pushing you know
cause what you’re trying to do is to to to to free the aorta from from
the connective tissue around it to get back to the spine You know
sometimes actually almost always I’ll use a metallic Pediatric yang
cower That is sort of one of my the suction or dissection tools of
choice is is pediatric Yankauer which is small and profile It’s got a
blunt tip It will you know it is a suction device And so that’s
usefuland you know kind of this combination of pushing a little bit of
maths here and there Metzenbaum scissorsand and a little bit of feeling
with your finger so you can get that connective tissue aorta freed and
then you know you can begin one can begin toto you know use a right
angle a big right angle and and try to to you know to get underneath it
Obviously what you’re looking for here in [00:24:00] part is is a Is
lumbar you know you’re looking for the lumbar vessels which you know
those are the things you need to leave behind for at least by as we tell
our residents you know find the outside before you find the inside you
can find them outside before you find the inside of a lumbar Then you
can clip ityou know another I think very useful tool in this situation
is is having large Weck cliffs you know because you’re not it’s very
difficult to pass you know a silk to lie gate a lumbar And in these
situations a lot of times you know you need those large WEC medium to
large Weck clips to help you know get on either side of a of a lumbar
artery or vein</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great one quick point back to their renal vein I kind of
picked this up just as fast past week is you can really get a lot of
mobilization on the renal vein just by ligating some of the smaller
branchesout distantly on it not even the gonadal but sometimes the
adrenal vein and a few of those veins And you can really get you know
five centimeters a [00:25:00] mobilization of that renal vein which
should give you enough distance to clamp Um But now we’re going to go
intoeach vessel off the aorta I know this isn’t exactly what you’re
going to see in a trauma You don’t have isolated celiac artery injury or
isolated SMA injury but just for the sake of learning we’re going to
talk through each vessel and talk about the options of exposing it and
then repairing it So starting approximately a Dr. Rasmussencan you
discuss what the best ways to see the celiac artery are andany options
for repairing it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah So the you know the celiac arteryI guess the origin
of the celiac arterycan be seen either through the lesser SAC this is
again through you know an an sort of a I guess an anterior approach<br />
through the stackand this is would likely be very similar to the
exposure we talked about with a super celiac aortic exposure where the
cause retracted you know caudally down towards the pelvis[00:26:00] and
um You know that opening lesser sack and pulling the stomach down and
and sort of getting the pancreas to come down That will expose then the
the origin of the first centimeter to the celiac artery If the proximal
segment of the celiac artery is injured and bleeding then then the
repair optionsyou know I I think lend into the category of any vascular
know major vascular three If it can be prepared repaired primarily then
you know using<br />
four Oh five Oh proline future If it does a grazing wound and repairing
it primarily can be done then then that’s that’s one option if it’s a
largeyou know<br />
celiac artery injury that that cannot be repaired primarily and there’s
destruction of the wall Oftentimes you’re an individuals in a dam Really
a damage control situation there And repair is not so much Your first a
lot of thought You’re [00:27:00] really situation trying to just control
bleeding and save patient’s life And and so in those cases you know
controlling the celiac artery and even consider you know ligating it may
be necessaryyou know as a damage control maneuver at least initiallythe
other way to see the origin of the celiac artery is still left medial
visceral rotation So the maneuver we described before will show the
entire we’ll expose the the para visceral segment of the aorta</p>
<p>um to include the first centimeter to the celiac artery</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> so any keys to identifying the common hepatic artery and
againthoughts on ligation strategies and repairs</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So I think the you know I think I mean the common a
paddock you’ll need to that will not be able to be visualized through
the left medial visceral rotation that the common hepatic and getting
out into the [00:28:00] segments there of of the of the the major
branches of the celiac one we’ll need then in that case to be coming
from a you know a transparent to Neal you know anterior approach with a
lesser SAC And you know di identifying the common a paddockyou know is
isMmm You know requires sort of a recognition of where the celiac artery
is You’re in the lesser SAC The stomach really has to be Ah inferiorly
This is again if you find yourself operating in this space you know the
the the costal margins as I said to begin really have to be flared And
almost suspended upso that you’ve really opened this Sometimes reverse
Trendelenburg is useful getting a hand a resident or a med student’s
hand to pull the stomach downand open up that that that spaceum it you
know that that will then should expose then the you know the the the
second and third segments of the celiac and its major branches to
include the common [00:29:00] hepatic artery</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great And so as far as like getting the common hepatic artery
how does the GDA play into this And by that I mean the gastroduodenal
artery</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> I mean you know the the the the GDA is as I guess is most
commonly the case is you know and and listeners know is Really one of
the first or the first branch of the common hepatic artery and and
really defines the junction between the common hepatic and proper
paddock arteriesand I thinkI mean ideally um The common hepatic should
should not ideally you don’t want to legging any of these arteries right
So I think that we start with that premise to say geez if we can get a
repair done that’s going to be our that’s going to beoption awhether
that’s the common hepatic proper paddock or GDA just like any artery in
the body like 18 it may be required as it is a damage control maneuver
just to control hemorrhage [00:30:00] let the patient recover a little
bit talk to anesthesia and sort of see how things are going Make an
assessment of of of the region distal to where you’ve liked it So so
this is just a basic tenant of like aiding any artery in a damage
control situation we recognize no matter which artery rely gating the
consequences of that ligation or we need to assess those consequences
and then and then address them if we’re able if patients you know able
to um to move to the next step Soobviously liking the comment of paddock
distal to the GDA likely to Render you know a significant portion of the
of the duodenum the pancreas and and then the liver is schemicand so you
know if the light station can occur proximal if the injury is proximal
to the GDA um then you know that would and G and perfusion can be
maintained into the GDA then that’s that’s preferable[00:31:00]but if I
was in one of these situations or when I am And we find ourselves having
to like ate it or we like hated it We didn’t quite know cause we didn’t
but we had to you know I was bleeding and there was a clip when we had a
damage control overand now Jeannie or the common paddock or the proper
paddocks lie dated Now what I usually will talk to anesthesia We’ll get
the patient as resuscitate as we can We’ll get out the Doppler we’ll
make an assessment because you know dependent upon patients can tolerate
but depending on the resuscitation status collateral where your legation
isyou know they may be able to tolerate having any one of those vessels
legged If on the other hand without your Doppler and you get the patient
resuscitate as possible and there’s clear aschemia then you’re going to
be faced with the decision whether or not we need a reconstruct the this
leg vessel shuntedor you know it may be situation where you have to deal
with the metabolic consequences and leave the [00:32:00] leave at like
eight There’s not one answer You know that I think there’s a there’s not
one answer that applies to all situations It’s a I think it’s a learning
and adhering to the principles of damage control resuscitation and
damage control surgery</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Absolutelyso off the record dr real quick I think you miss
said the distal and proximal cause you can lie gate the you can like it
The common a paddock Proximal to the GDA because you’ll have retrograde
flow from the GDA into the proper hepatic Rightcould you just say that
sentence and one more time and then</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Sure what I guess what I’m what I’m meant to say And I
don’t you know actually looking at a diagram so I can try to see the so
what I meant to say is that you can often lie gait the common hepatic
proximal GDA keeping a retrograde filling into the GDA and maintaining a
viability of the Dudina and the pancreatic head</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Perfect Thank you Okay And now let’s dive into the Um and
this is you know very close in proximity to the celiac artery So many of
the options to visualize it will be the same but there’s some unique
differences A is with its relationship with the pancreas Um so briefly
doctor asked me Jason what are our options to see the SMA and and and do
we kind of think of SMA kind of in portions a little differently than
some</p>
<p>other vessels</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Definitely So the the SMAyou know the the the pathway
really to see the first centimeter to the SMA superior mesenteric artery
is is through the left medial visceral rotation which will which will
show the entire pair visceral segment of the order including [00:33:00]
for centimeter two of the superior mesenteric artery If If more exposure
needs to be um you know if if one is trying to expose more distal
segments of the SFA then one probably have to go back to the anterior
approach not the left mijo visceral rotation and go through the approach
And in this case then the the superior mesic Terrick artery is of course
closely related to the head of the pancreas And and and and and so in
this situation that the head of the pancreas Well it needs to be you
knowdivided or you know the the SMA is closely adherent to the head of
the pancreas in this case distal of the segment of the superior
mesenteric artery distal to the pancreas is often now best seen in an
infra And these a call like approach And this this is the superior
mesenteric artery exits the second segment and its relation with the
[00:34:00] pancreas and comes out into the the root of the mesentery and
into the into the the small bowel This is where for example Mmm Mmm One
with lift the transverse colon cephalad as we described beforeand and
retract the small bowel to the patient’s right and see the the the root
of the SMA below and and inferior to the to the transverse colon So yes
there there are these stink segments of the superior mesenteric
arteryexpose Each of those segments um has a little bit of a different
anatomic approach And and then and each of those segments hasyou know I
think considerations that are important that relate to surrounding
structures you know whether that’s the obviously the pancreas the root
of the transfers colon</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> thank you for taking us through those complicated anatomy of
the SMA as it kind of traverses the abdomenyou know in [00:35:00] all of
these vessels obviously we you know primary repair is kind of our our
our first option if possible And then many times you may need to
interposition graftJust you know I know this is a question that is very
case dependent is there a portion of the SMA that you can lie gate and
or is a is SMA just a no</p>
<p>ligation zone throughout</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well that’s a great question AndI think similar to other
other large axial vessels or arteriesyou know the more distal segments
is just going to be better tolerated than like eating the you know the
proximal proximal segments So um You know I would not say it’s a no
ligation zone in its throughout its entiretybut I do thinkyou know that
if possibleefforts should be maintained or efforts should be undertaken
to maintain flow through the SMA through you know through through its
entiretyand you know repairing the SMA [00:36:00] just it depends upon
the injuryif it is a small grazing Wound Then then you know perhaps a
primary repair can be undertaken with a FORO or a five O proline
sutureum if it’s a more substantial wound um and and one can get it
controlledand and isolate it you know than than repair can be Um
Undertaken with a patchy angioplasty or even an interposition graft
That’s pretty rare And because those wounds are just so mortal um it’s
very different You know patients who have those sorts of axial injuries
at the proximal portions of these message check vessels typically don’t
surviveum And so you know it’s very difficult I I can’t think of a time
when I’ve necessarily been repairing for trauma the proximal segment or
two of of the SMA it’s a little bit different for an elective tumor
resection atherosclerotic occlusive disease and such But for
trauma[00:37:00] Um you know it’s it’s it’s pretty uncommon to be doing
extensive repair of of these SMA segments I don’t I don’t know what your
experience is or our thoughts are on that</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I certainly have had zero experience preparing SMA injuries
Um but</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think it’s just pretty uncommon</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong>I know that like you said in her position grafting is probably
more theoretical than realistic in a situation like this But can you
talk about the technique for it Maybe it may be useful for other types
of situations but what what what material are you using where you’re
where you’re bringing the graph from and how you tunnel it</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I was just going to say I think you guys are exactly right
And and and Adam and I both experienced this is yeah many times we’re
not seeing traumas with these injuries but many times we’re getting
called by the surgical oncologist with a kind of can’t cancer injury to
these vessels And so I think when we’re discussing SMA we can kind of
keep it in the perspective of how do we replace it if we need to Um and
in the situation where they need to do some larger sections So with that
in mind a doctor asked [00:38:00] can W can you tell us how you would
bypass it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah So I think that theI think that in these cases you
know and as I said in a rare situation in the setting of trauma if
you’ve if you’ve or able to establish proximal and distal control and
side-branch control of this segment and then you know your options for
reconstructing it um with an interposition graftyou know would would
include using a prosthetic like PTFE or Dacron or an autologous tissue
like vein And here it it just it depends it depends on how prepared you
know you are with the with patient for example as a patient prepped
where the one could harvest either the very proximal segment of greater
saffron is Fein or or a segment of deep femoral vein which which
mayactuallyYou know have a better size match to the proximal portions of
the SMA Um and and if that’s the [00:39:00] case you know if there’s
Interra contamination either from a tumor resection or from an injury
than it is preferable of course to to use autologous conduit such as
deep vein deep femoral vein a small segment of deep femoral vein or if
the if the saphenous at its proximal extent is It’s large enough you can
one can use thatif that’s not possible for example the leg isn’t prepped
or or the expertise that is not available to to harvest the deep vein
then I think using a small segment of rifampin soaked Dacron graft would
be probably what I would useand you know you get some rifampin from the
pharmacy you get a probably a six or eight millimeter Diameter a segment
of Dacron and that’s your inner position graph as far as tunneling it
that and and and how to route it That sort of depends upon the
injuryobviously the the the proximal most segments of The [00:40:00] SMA
are you know right underneath the pancreasif if this involves for
example a Whipple procedure where the head of the pancreas has got to
come out and and and with that approximal portion of the SMA then um you
know then then that’s probably gonna require a six or eight millimeter
diameter interposition graft you know to replace that And And if it’s
more distal and the SMA and now it’s you know in the infra means a colic
The transverse colon is off and you’re and they end up in the injury or
the the segment is is for examplebelowthe the the transverse colon and
that’s going to be you know three or four millimeters and it may be
there that vein you know sadness pain would would work or in some of
those cases a patch angioplasty using vein is actually</p>
<p>easier and better than than trying to do an interposition graft to sort
of debris the the injury and then and then do a patch angioplasty using
a segment of a saphenous vein</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> All right One follow up questionin these situations with SMA
[00:41:00] injuries so you were a parent and the bowel doesn’t look
infarcted or threatened at the time Do you think it’s mandatory to leave
these patients open and do a second look even if everything is fine on
the first timedo you think you can kind of take it on a case by case
basis</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think and I think you’re getting at a a an
important point here which is one we’ve emphasized throughout our
discussion is that none of these these procedures these these techniques
that we’re describing take place in isolation right They they they have
to be in conjunction with anesthesia and an assessment of the patient’s
physiology And And the whole team including the intensive care unit team
et cetera So it’s a really good pointMy own preference in these
situations is to leave the leave the abdomen open with a temporary
abdominal closure of some sort and plan a look Um you know 24 to 36
hours later I I really That I thinkit I think we know that the morbidity
of [00:42:00] of that approach is is very low I suspectyou know um I
think it probably provides not just reassurance but probably some real
advantages in case the the the perfusion actually is not adequate and
the patient becomes acidemic and the bowel is compromised you know
subsequent to To a pure initial departure from the or</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great And just to breeze through the inferior mesenteric
artery would you agree that you can generally like gate this with
impunity if it’s damaged in a trauma</p>
<p>situation</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong>I think never say like eight with impunitybut I because
there’s always situations whereYou know I think it has to be thoughtful
a ligation and in this case yes I think the majority of times the the
inferior mesenteric artery can be ligatedI think the thoughtful approach
here is to make an assessment as of to the patency of the iliac vessels
and specifically the internal iliac vessels I think if What we’re
[00:43:00] describing which is ligation of the inferior mesenteric
artery one can be more assured that that’s going to be tolerated if both
internal iliac arteries are patent for exampleif the SMA is paid and the
celiac is paid and then then the inferior mesenteric artery is almost
always tolerated Um if for some If it’s an aged person who’s got
occluded internal iliacs or they’ve got atherosclerosis lucid disease
and their mesenteries are not good then I think you have to be a little
worried about ligating the Ima in some cases</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Right And just for residents that’ll be rounding I think we
generally discuss when talking about the Ima and you know open aorta
situations if it’s occluded Or it’s pulsatile then we feel comfortable
like eating it It’s when it has that kind of a slight dribble back that
we may consider re implanting itjust to kind of prepare you for your
roundsdr SPC and we’re going to jump into the last vessel of branches
[00:44:00] of the aorta Not an easy one to discuss either we’re going to
get the renal arteriesandYou know I I know it differs kind of whether
it’s proximal or distal it very much as far as your exposurebut how how
do you think of the renal arteries in your management of them in a
traumatic situations</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> think that it’sI think that what I’m thinking about in
that question isIs similar these other vessels that thatand and
hopefully it’s helpful as a broad principle and an approach you knowwe
started this discussion talking about exposure and making sure
communicate with anesthesia and you know having the right suction
devices and retracting devices and headlights in these broad concepts to
make sure that you you’ve thought about um going into these casesyou
know I think um when it comes to the renal arteries like like all these
festivals um it’s useful to think well I’m either in a in a fairly
elective situation you know meaning I’ve got things under control for
the moment Patient’s physiology is a [00:45:00] solid um you know
there’s there’s whatever bleeding there is is controlled and I I’ve got
a reasonable exposure in contrast toI am in a uncontrolled situation and
there’s the patients in a in a really bad situationyou know the bleeding
is not controlled I don’t know where the bleeding is coming from et
cetera And I think because it helps one toHave a mindset about whether
I’m pursuing damage control surgery you know am I going to have to how
how much am I going to work to maintain a patency of this vessel or am I
going to be more tolerant of litigating it and just as a damage
controlman over and having to deal with the consequences but recognizing
I need to do it to say the patient’s life So the renal arteries are like
that I think because it is similar to the SMA it is pretty unlikely in
the setting of trauma to be reconstructing a renal artery I think that’s
pretty rare in trauma that the kidney the renal artery is
either[00:46:00] Not injuredyou know not injured And you know there’s
there’s hematoma that is from the parenchyma of the kidney or
surrounding vessels or the renal artery is injured and Broncos you know
and and And if it’s certainly if it’s injured in thrombose by the time
you know an individual gets to it it’s probably too late The scheming
time or mosquito time to the kidney’s been too great and there’s not
going to be value of of of trying to reconstruct it in the setting of
trauma And so if it happens to be an in between and I say well let’s say
that a actually it is one of these cases where you know explore the The
the zone two hematoma and a is coming from a main renal arterythen you
know and there’s flow in it but it’s bleeding Then I think the
principles that we have described such as either primary repair four or
five Oh potentially probably in this case maybe a six O monofilament
sutures such as proline It would be useful if that appears to [00:47:00]
compromise the lumen andeither a patch angioplasty of that artery or you
know a bypass But again that is extremely rare in the setting of
traumayou know if it’s going to require more than than a primary
repairyou know it’s I think in my experience equally likely that you
know you’re going to beligating that vessel for damage control</p>
<p>Um but but it’s pretty rare to be doing a complex renal artery repair in
the setting of of trauma similar to the proximal SMA injuries for
example</p>
<p>It just pretty rare</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> right Can you talk to us about your emotions You’re dealing
with your renal hematomas whether they’re Penetrating or blind I know
the old adage of every penetrating renal hematoma should be explored and
blood one should not be explored unless they’re expanding May not be
true but can you kind of walk us through how you approached this</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So you know zone two this would be a you know zone
one or the central dominal hematomas and you know the rules that
[00:48:00] you’re alluding to or that you know almost all or all zone
one hematomas should be exploredZone two hematomas which are the kidneys
in the lateral gutters<br />
basicallyyou know the the the general rule is that if it’s a expanding
hematoma regardless if the mechanism is blunt or penetrating then those
hematomas Should be explored in zone two Um the general rule goes as
most of your listeners know if it’s a blunt injury and the zone two
hematoma is not expanding then that does not need to be exploredIn
contrast if it’s a zone to hematoma from a penetrating mechanism then
most of the time though than need to be explored even if the hematomas
is stable Those are the general rules that we we use to guide our
approach to zone two a retroperitoneal or zone to retroparotoneil
hematoma So I use those I think that’s those are pretty goodYou know I I
think there are times [00:49:00] when a blunt you know one finds
themselves in in in in the belly because there was a hemoperitoneum from
a another injury And and and and there is a blunt mechanism and there’s
a zone two hematoma I have explored those in the past And I think that
if I don’t think those guidelines are meant to be You know a dictums
that can never beadjusted for an individual case I’m not sure if that</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So one question I know a lot of times many of these cases we
don’t already have the laparotomy performed Um you know they’re in the
trauma Bay They get a CT scan and they they call and say there’s an
intimal flap There’s a fistula maybe a pseudo aneurysm and the renal
artery any kind of general principles for</p>
<p>some of these sort of</p>
<p>incidental findings</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> and I think that’s a that’s probably a so what you
described there is is the most obviously I guess the most common
scenario in which which which it’s a The CT finding you know right in or
just after the resuscitation room of a of a of a main [00:50:00] renal
artery injury branch renal artery injury or maybe you know parenchymal
injury to the kidneyand in those casesI think if the let’s say it’s the
intimal flap that you described If the intimal flap is Either not Mateen
and there’s perfusion in the kid on that CT scan for exampleand it does
not appear to be flow limiting then that can be observed some of those
like other blond arterial injury some of those will healif it is
amenable to an endovascular placement of a bare metal stent that Can be
used in some institutions to tack downor stabilize that detection Um and
that will be if if if you really feel like it is a flow limiting more
than 50% stenosis caused by that intimal flap the more distal branch
artery injuries can often also be managed with endovascular techniques
such as [00:51:00] coil embolization Replacement of an occlusive you
know hemostat coil or other deviceand I think coil embolizing or or or
treating those depends uponyou know how the patient is doing how much
blood they’re requiring how large the hematoma isand then what their
hemodynamics arebut I think for those reasons what we described five or
10 minutes ago um having to fix these main these these renal artery
injuries in the ORs pretty uncommon because they’ve either been
diagnosed and managedbased off CT with or without endo Endovascular
technologies and oftentimes the management of a renal artery injury If
you’re in the or exploring and expanding you know hematoma and one of
the zone twos is is going to be nephrectomy you know because it’s it’s
that major injury in which there’s just not there’s not the [00:52:00]
indication for</p>
<p>repair</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> all the ranches of the aorta from the diaphragm Down to the
renals and Ima And I want to thank you very very much for taking a
complex topic and it’s sort of convoluted in breaking it down from
technical steps to algorithms for exposure to how to repair I think this
was overall an excellent episode Well we haven’t touched on the
endovascular management of trauma which we’ll save for another
episodebut thank you so much for for a great discussion I for recipes</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> well I applaud you for tackling this topic is unruly you
know it both in the the anatomy the anatomic exposure operative exposure
and then the seemingly endless number of scenariosThat can be considered
for either observation repair or damage control ligation I mean it’s a
it’s a it’s a complex topic I would commend you for tackling it and I
hope that our discussion is is useful for for you and</p>
<p>and your listeners</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> [00:53:00] Definitely I think this gives people the the
groundwork to really make some safe decisionsone thing I want to mention
to our listeners if you click on our show notes or you go to audible
bleeding.com we’re going to have links to different YouTube videos that
will have breakdowns of many of these exposures so you can listen to
this and then go watch it later to really reinforce itso thank you dr

<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> [00:00:00] Okay,
and welcome back to behind the knife and audible bleeding vascular
trauma podcasts with our guest, Dr. Todd Rasmussen. Dr. Rasmussen is a
Colonel in the United States air force, and he’s a professor of surgery
and associate Dean of research at the uniform services university of
health science and an attending vascular surgeon at Walter Reed.</p>
<p>National military medical center. We’re continuing our [00:01:00] series
today on vascular trauma. He is the editor of the riches vascular
trauma, and he’s been gracious enough to join us and help us, , dive
into these discussions. Um, and today we actually have, , one of my
co-fellows and audible bleeding host, , Nicole Rich, , Nicole, thanks
for joining.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Thanks for having me.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Um, all right,
Dr. Rasmussen, , welcome back to audible bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Thanks a lot
for having me. I’m looking forward to, , to the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> So we just want
to start with some of the basics here. Um, for the tenants of managing
patients with suspected cerebrovascular injuries, um, what are some of
the principles we have to keep in mind when we, when we’re called the
trauma Bay on a patient like this.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Well, I think
that, , there’s, there’s some, , of the key tenants that are very much
alike. I’m with the tenants of vascular injury, , and other anatomic
locations. Um, and then there’s, there certainly are some unique facets
to cerebrovascular injury. That are different, , than, than other,
anatomic regions.</p>
<p>So, you know, I [00:02:00] think to begin with, um, the key tenants that
are, that are similar relate to, , bleeding control. So that if, , if it
is , in the cervical region or the region of cerebrovascular, , ,
trauma, there’s active bleeding then, then of course, that, . , from the
vascular injury, then that takes precedent that we have to take measures
either with manual compression or, , other, other mechanisms to control
the bleeding and resuscitate the patient.</p>
<p>I think unlike other, um, vascular injury, , patterns, cerebrovascular
injury, or cervical, , vascular injury in the cervical region also, ,
can quickly compromise the airway. And so I think, . You know, those
making sure that there’s control of, of, of catastrophic bleeding, , and
then making sure that, , that the vascular injury is not immediately
compromising the airway or are our two tenants that are</p>
<p>common with other vascular injury patterns and one is unique to this
area.[00:03:00] Um, and then I think also unique to this areas is, um,
the, the neuro status of the patient. , is the patient, um, awake or
Tundra or asleep, or is the patient awake? And does the patient have,
um, signs of hemispheric. stroke, , or ischemia.</p>
<p>Um, and I think depending upon, , the injury pattern and the, the
overall status of the patient, making a, , an assessment and being
particularly aware of the patient’s neuro status, , in, in these
anatomic region is very important.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Definitely. So,
um, to highlight is in these patients, we want to prevent secondary
injury. Um, so, um, if they have a brain injury, um, we’re going to. Do
everything we can to keep their blood pressure, prevent hypotension,
prevent hypoxia. And then like dr Rajistan and said, we really need to
make sure we have a good neuro exam.</p>
<p>as soon and as good of a neuro exam is as possible. Um, and I know the
situation’s very, um,</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> . So Dr. Rasmussen, can you
talk to us about what types of patients and what patterns of injuries
[00:04:00] should. , Clewis into a potential for blood carotid injury
when we should have a high index of suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Sure. I think
there, um, certainly are on the physical exam. , there are, there are
findings that will cue the provider, , to the high suspicion for, um. A
blunt carotid injury, um, most commonly is some sort of external Mark on
the neck, , or, , around the thoracic outlet of, , of the patient. Um,
for example, a seatbelt Mark, um, , or some sort of a choke Mark or
such.</p>
<p>So if there’s external signs of injury, um. , around the, the color
region of the cervical region of the patient. That certainly should cue,
, the provider end. I think there’s, there are, um, , I think other
findings on physical exam, um, if the patient is, has unilateral, ,
signs that suggest hemispheric ischemia or a stroke, um, I think that is
uncommon.</p>
<p>But I think that obviously. , if the patient’s awake enough and is
demonstrating, um, um. Um, demonstrating physical [00:05:00] findings
that suggest a hemispheric aschemia or stroke. I think that certainly is
another, , another, um, finding that would cue someone in, , to looking
more closely for, , a blunt carotid injury.</p>
<p>I think the, the types of injuries, mechanisms of injury, I think I
mentioned the seatbelt injury, I mean, a car accident. Um, for, um, is,
is, is kind of a typical, , or common injury pattern in civilian
settings where, um, you know, the, the seatbelt itself has caused a, um,
, a blunt injury, , after or during a car accident.</p>
<p>So I think that is a mechanism of injury that should also, cue someone
in.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Yeah, and I think
for the behind the knife listeners that are listening, um, it’s really
important to have this high index of suspicion because if you guys don’t
identify these as the trauma surgeons, as the general surgeon on call,
these patients can have devastating outcomes. So really being. Alert and
aware for these patients with complex facial fractures, these closed
hit, closed head injuries, and the seatbelt signs can really save lives
and get the [00:06:00] appropriate imaging to help rule in or out a a
carotid injury.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> You know, you
mentioned, um, TBI or head injury, and I think that is, that’s another
obviously very common. Mechanism and unis blunt. Carotid injury is
pretty rare. Um, I think as vascular surgeons or vascular. Trauma
specialists, we tend to see them more frequently cause we get called. ,
but for, for, um, those providers who are in the emergency department, ,
or are seeing you know, all forms of trauma and presentation.</p>
<p>I think a TBI, traumatic brain injury, um, , head injury and then
complex facial fractures, those, as you alluded to, are. You know, our
injury patterns where when you’re looking both in examining the patient,
but then, you know, these days in particular, when you get the CT scan,
really paying attention to, you know, the cervical vasculature is, is,
is particularly important.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Great. And then just a couple
other injuries that keep in mind for this type of, um, presentation as
[00:07:00] well would be , cervical vertebral body fractures or
transverse foramen fractures. And then also just in patients who’ve had
severe hyperextension rotation, reflection injuries of the neck.</p>
<p>Okay, great. So how do we classify and think about treating injuries
with, um, blunt credit injuries? What’s our grading system and how does
that dictate how we manage these.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Well, I think
that as we think about this one thinks about, the anatomy of the vessel
wall, the arterial wall. that helps us conceptualize the degree or the
severity of, of these blood carotid injuries. They can be, um, as simple
as a, as an intimal tear, , where, um, you know, it is, the intimate has
been raised off of the media and it creates a minor flow defect.</p>
<p>, which may be prone to platelet aggregation. Um, but it’s, it’s not a,
, a long dissection and it’s, it’s not a flow limiting defect, and that
is the [00:08:00] most minor. , and then of course, the most severe on
the other end of the spectrum is a blond carotid injury. That’s resulted
in. In, in complete thrombosis of the artery so that, , it’s either the
vessel has been transected from the blunt injury and is thrombosis or, ,
or the, the injury is this, such that the intimate is lifted up and it
has created a longer this section that is, that is now thrombosed and
occluded the vessel.</p>
<p>And then there’s the degrees of injury between those two extremes where.
There can be a longer does section, um, that, has thrombus associated
with it and is visible on the cat scan or the imaging modality, um, and
or, um, a dissection that can be flow limiting the defect that can be
flow limiting.</p>
<p>They may not have thrombus and it, or B along the section, but it, but
it is in itself flow limiting, meaning that it. It’s, , compromises
greater than 50%, for example, [00:09:00] of the, of the lumen of that
pestle. So, you know, the, the varying degrees of severity, um, you
know, with our imaging technologies today, mostly CTA, it is possible to
pick up, you know, or is.</p>
<p>If you’re able to pick up or proceed the different, , types of severity
from a, again, from a real mild intimal defect that’s not flow limiting,
that has no thrombus all the way to the more obvious, , you know, , ,
injury where there’s complete thrombosis.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Is there any role
for ultrasound, , in addition to CTA, if you do see some sort of intimal
flap, , to maybe see the, if there’s any hemodynamic impact of it, or is
it. Does CTA give you the information that you need.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> I think
that’s a really good point. I love, I really like ultrasound. I think
you alluded to this, um, with your comment, you know, CT gives you,
gives one a static image. , it’s often quite detailed and, , boy, I
really also think that CTA [00:10:00] is, I mean, in many ways it is the
gold standard, but it is a static image.</p>
<p>Yeah. In contrast, duplex ultrasound, which combines B mode, you know,
ultrasonography with POLST Doppler , gives one a real dynamic, um,
assessment of the area of interest. Meaning is, is the, um, is there, I
mentioned the word flow limiting is, is there a elevated velocity and a
detriment in, in, in.</p>
<p>Or a change or a difference in the velocities around that area. So I
think, I think you can get a lot of information with duplex though. Of
course, the limitation with duplex, and we may talk about this, um, when
we talk about the different zones of. Of of, of neck injury, you know,
the, the limitation with duplex is it, it you cannot see above the angle
of the mandible.</p>
<p>So you quickly kind of run out of real estate distally where you can use
duplex. It’s not good for distal internal carotid injuries and you
cannot see, you know, proximal to the thoracic outlet. [00:11:00] So,
you know, there is a limited window in which duplex is useful. But, ,
but in that window, I think it gives really important information.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> That’s a great point. So going
back to the grading of the injuries, , Dr. Rasmussen, you described to
us a grade one and grade two injuries, which involve intimal injuries, ,
less than 25% in grade one or grade two with a greater than 25% luminal
narrowing. Um, can you talk about the management of grade one and two
injuries.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, I think
I’m grade one and grade two injuries. Um. Most of the time are managed
non-operatively and can be managed expectantly with, , use of
antiplatelet therapy, potentially anticoagulation. Um, depending upon,
um, the patient’s global burden of trauma. Do they have an associated
TBI? Do they have other, other injuries?</p>
<p>But. Um, if, if there are, if the patient is [00:12:00] neurologically
intact, um, and a grade one or grade two injury is seen on imaging, um,
and the patient is able to have anti-platelet or anticoagulation
therapy, then those, those types of great injuries, grade one and grade
two are managed. Non-operatively, , with, , I guess you’d say medical
management.</p>
<p>If the patient changes, meaning that he or she was initially
neurologically normal, um, and medical management is initiated and then
the patient changes has hemispheric symptoms indicating that your
medical management is failing. Then that is a situation where, , an
intervention is, is this likely to be needed or would be indicated, um,
if that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> That drives me is
to have a question. Um, have you ever been in a situation where you have
a grade one or two injury, but a [00:13:00] patient that you’re unable
to get a neuro exam on? Are we obligated to, um, ask for things such as
transcranial Doppler or EEG or, or, or something to prove that there’s
no injury from that or, you know, what are your thoughts on a situation
like that?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Great
question, and I think I’m. I’ll probably use this phrase multiple times
in this discussion. Is it? It depends, um, partly it depends on what
modalities, one has available to them in their institution, but I think
the answer to that, if I could, um, if I come down from on it, is, no,
you’re not obligated.</p>
<p>I think it’s a luxury. , that some places may have that if you have
access to EEG or transcranial Doppler, it might be able to be used or
sort of a luxury in your diagnosis, but I don’t think that’s really
necessary. I would mostly treat them, as I said, with medical management
and then imaging, serial [00:14:00] imaging, both.</p>
<p>Of their neck and, of their brain. Um, and I think in a way, and then
you mentioned it earlier, Kevin, I thought that was really important. ,
supportive measures, like preventing, secondary injury, you know, which
means optimize the profusion pressure to the brain. , try to avoid or
lessen the likelihood of secondary insults such as hypotension, shock
and, and such.</p>
<p>So I don’t think you’re obligated to get those things. I think that
things like EEG, transcranial Doppler are more in the category of a
luxury if you have them. Um, but otherwise I would manage with a serial
imaging.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> So Dr. Rasmussen in a patient
who remains neurologically intact and you plan to, um, that medically
manage and do serial imaging, what’s the best timing for repeat imaging?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, that’s
a great question. And I, I think, um, for, um, for patients that we
manage and in my experience, we manage, we at least image him twice in
the hospital. While they’re an [00:15:00] inpatient. So, , to make sure
that they’re not changing or evolving, you know, in the acute phase of
their injury. So, um, you know, if, , if, .</p>
<p>The typical patient is someone with a, you know, with a blunt, um, head
injury and they have a finding at the time of, , of a grade one or grade
two carotid injury. Um, we get the CT at the time. They’re admitted to
diagnose it. We follow them, you know, over the course of three or four
or five days as they recover from their injury.</p>
<p>They need another imaging study, I think within, you know, within the
first week to make sure that that. Grade one or grade two injury has not
evolved into an either a pseudo aneurysm, because remember, there’s a,
by definition, a disruption of the arterial wall or an extension, you
know, from a grade one or grade two into something that’s more, more
significant.</p>
<p>So I think the initial scan on admission, of course, and then within the
first seven days to make sure they’ve not, that injuries not evolving.
Um, [00:16:00] and then typically after that, I think, again, it depends
on. Um, sort of the severity and how the patient’s doing, but probably
at a month after discharge from the hospital and then most of them will
heal.</p>
<p>, certainly grade ones will heal, hopefully grade two, but, but they do
need followed, , to the point of resolution or healing as an outpatient.
, usually with CT scans or CTA.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay, great. And series of
these patients have shown that 60% of them will have their injuries
devolve or change in greater severity in this period. Is the pattern
that you see typically that they tend to improve over time?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Well, I think
the, um, I think the grade, you know, the grade ones, , I think they do.
Um, they’re, those are the ones where that’s a minor or limited intimal
disruption. A small intimal flap that. that is not flow limiting. It’s
not associated with thrombus or platelet aggregation or thrombus.</p>
<p>So I think most of the grade ones do, and I [00:17:00] think, I’m sure
the grade twos, I think it certainly a greater percentage of those are
prone to evolve into, you know, a longer deception formation of thrombus
around them or into a pseudo aneurysm. And so that’s the, the point of,
of serial imaging. You know, within the first week of the injury.</p>
<p>, and then certainly, you know, , another one within the first month of
the injury he had at best case, certainly if they begin to evolve or you
see on that second CT. That the image that the injury’s changing, let’s
say it’s a grade two to your point that you think and you see signs that
it’s evolving, then by all means then that that needs then more
intensive imaging and likely if it’s evolving into something more
significant, it needs an intervention.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay, so a pseudo aneurysm is
what we consider grade three. what is your approach to managing a pseudo
aneurysm of the carotid?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, so I
think the, the suitor aneurysms [00:18:00] of the carotid, um, you know,
that in a way it depends. It’s influenced certainly on, um, the
patient’s neuro status or the location of the pseudo aneurism. And then
I think the expertise of, of the team that’s managing the patient. Um,
but I think that the pseudo aneurysms, um, all of them, no matter what
size they, they need to be treated, they, they require, um, you know,
um, they require an intervention to fix them.</p>
<p>Um, there certainly are some patients who, um. Who’s you know, have a
high mortality. They, they’re, they’re, they’re quite ill or have a
high, high injury severity score. They may not make it. There’s some
patients that one may pass and not fix a pseudo aneurysm or grade three
entry, but by and large, most do because the pseudo aneurysms will.</p>
<p>, will, um, they will not go away. Then they’re likely to get bigger and
become associated with either expansion and mass effect or bleeding or
thrombus formation, stroke. Um, so, um, the, the ways to treat them, I
think are [00:19:00] these days primarily with endovascular techniques
that include covering, , the pseudo aneurysm with a small coverage
stent.</p>
<p>Or what we’d call a stent graft, a small covered stent to seal the, the
opening of the pseudo aneurysm. You know, there are some reports and
experiences using what we call a bare metal stent, um, through which
coils can be placed to thrombose the pseudo aneurysm to cause it to
clot. And then the bare metal stent then, you know, maintains the
integrity of the wall.</p>
<p>Um. Such that, flow is maintained through the, through the lumen, those
both use of a stent graft or recovered stent or coiling of the pseudo
aneurysm, or interventional techniques or endovascular techniques that
are performed most commonly through a transfemoral approach, an RJ order
gram, and then selection of the.</p>
<p>of the [00:20:00] effected carotid artery and then placement of the, of
the endovascular treatment. Um, I think those, these days are probably
the most common. Certainly if, it is, um, in, you know, in zone two of
the neck, and we can talk about that a little bit. , and it’s amenable
to an operation. Um, there’s another indication for an operation in that
area than, than certainly open repair of the pseudo aneurysm can also
be.</p>
<p>Undertaken, but I think more commonly these days for grade two injuries,
they’re managed with an endovascular technique.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> In your book,
it’s mentioned that, um, considering waiting seven days to decrease
neuro events, , what’s the thought behind this?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah,
definitely. I think that, if a patient, um. You know, Harrigan, it
depends. I think that it depends on the patient. There are some patients
who just are in no shape to undergo. Um, you know, , , an intervention
such as this in the acute, , in the acute setting, the first two or
three days and, and certainly in those patients waiting is, is just, you
don’t have a choice.</p>
<p>You need to wait. I think Yeah. If the patients, um, [00:21:00] you
know, are awake, let’s say they’re awake and otherwise normal, um, you
know, in those patients, if they’re, if it’s a pseudo aneurysm, the
patient’s awake and, , able to be examined. I, I often don’t wait seven
days. I think the waiting period probably more pertains to patients with
polytrauma, maybe an associated TBI and, and a, and a more complex, ,
complex course.</p>
<p>I think if it’s more. A cut and dry, the patient’s awake, , able to be
examined. They’re out of the unit. , then I don’t wait necessarily seven
days.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Got it. So, , for
the grade four injuries, , the occlusions, we just do medical management
for these patients if they’re already included. can you just talk to us
briefly about, how you decide on medical management, whether you were
using anti-platelets or dual anti-platelets or anticoagulation?</p>
<p>How do you go about this?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. So this
is really, um, an area where it is, um, you know, we don’t have a lot of
good, we don’t have really any good data. We have. [00:22:00] Really
good clinical experiences by a lot of expert groups, but we don’t have a
lot of, um, prospective data or level one data that guides our
management in these cases.</p>
<p>Um, and so I think, um, patients with occluded, let’s say a blunt
carotid and secluded grade for injury, um, patients who do not have
associated injuries or conditions. That preclude the use of
anticoagulation, then I will use the anticoagulation. We’ll, we’ll give
them, , intravenous heparin, um, and, um, monitor them with repeat
imaging and obviously, um, monitor them to make sure they’re not over
anticoagulated in pain.</p>
<p>And that tends to be the exception because many of these patients have
polytrauma, so they have an associated TBI. Or other body regions that
have been severely injured. So that anticoagulation is not an option.
And in those cases, , we are really left with using, um. , [00:23:00] an
antiplatelet like, um, clopidogrel or aspirin.</p>
<p>In those cases, I’ll often use both, , dual antiplatelet therapy,
clopidogrel and aspirin. And these are in patients who cannot receive
full anticoagulation because of other injuries. Um, one point there, I
think if, if one’s going to use anticoagulation, and I think this group,
Um, you know, Kevin, you and Nicole are, and those of us who get called
frequently for bleeding complications are sensitive to this.</p>
<p>But in these, these patients, we’re going to use anticoagulation on for
a blunt grade four blond carotid injury. I really try to avoid, ,
protocol based, bolusing. Of anticoagulation. I think our internal
medicine friends and often our intensivist get into these protocols
where they’ll use large boluses of heparin as if the patient’s being
treated for a PE.</p>
<p>And I think that, I try to avoid that because I, in my experience, that
leads to [00:24:00] bleeding complications either in the brain. The neck
or somewhere else in these injured patients. So I typically will, when I
start anticoagulation on these patients start pretty slow with a goal
PTT of 50 to 70 and in the first 24 hours, I often will say 50 is better
than 70 because these patients with this type of trauma are just prone
to bleed.</p>
<p>Um, and then work up slowly to therapeutic anticoagulation without
boluses. Um, and again, these are patients that they use the
anticoagulation and the don’t have on the, they shouldn’t have other
major injuries. So then they get transitioned to an oral anticoagulant
for, 30 to 90 days.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> That’s a really
good point.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay, great. So why don’t we
move on to discuss blend for tibial artery. Injuries, um, Dr. Rasmussen,
when you’re assessing a patient’s imaging who is presenting with a
trauma and a blunt vertebral artery injury, what are the kinds of things
that you look for in terms of the dominance of the vertebral,[00:25:00]
um, and how that affects your management?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, good
point. And you’ve used. Kindly, , , tips, um, pointing me in the right
direction. I think it, depends upon, you know, one of the main things
is, , well, first of all, starting with a physical exam, and as we’ve
mentioned, you know, how, how is the patient, when you first assess
them, do they have.</p>
<p>No signs of bleeding in the neck, airway compromise, et cetera. But
then, you know, quickly with these patients, and to your point, you get
to the imaging and, and I think one of the key things is it, which
vertebral, is it the dominant vertebral artery that is affected? Or is
it the diminutive, um, for TBL? Or, or maybe you can’t tell.</p>
<p>Um, but I think that is important. Um, and then I think, It’s similar in
some ways to the carotid injuries. It’s the severity of that vertebral
injury, both its location, um, anatomically which of the vertebral
segments. And then, you know, what is the, what is the severity of the
injury?</p>
<p>Is that a mild. grade one intimal flap [00:26:00] that’s sort of seems
non flow limiting, or is it a full full blown occlusion, , , of the
vertebral? And then lastly, is it associated with a baseline artery
defactor posterior circulation, stroke? Those are sort of the things
that I try to go through in my mind.</p>
<p>Um. As I look at the imaging, you know, one thing that’s important to
mention, and we were just talking about this with one of our residents
or trainees, , last week we did a first rib resection and talked about,
um, the severity of, of impact that it takes to make these create these
sorts of sorts of injuries.</p>
<p>You know, I think. What I would say is yes, be focused on the vertebral
artery, or in the case of the carotid, be focused on the carotid, but
also be aware that in, oftentimes these cases can be associated with
other torso, vascular injuries, blunt aortic injuries and such. So, you
know, like, like we always try to do ourselves or teach.</p>
<p>You know, don’t get tunnel [00:27:00] vision with these patients. Look
at their imaging with regards to the vertebral, but also be aware that,
, they often have other injuries that you need to open the aperture to
see.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> That’s great.
from my experience, , most of these injuries of the routine rules are
managed non-operatively or occasionally with embolization, maybe, um, by
neuro, I R. unless there’s maybe a pseudo aneurysm, and per your book,
90% of these stenotic lesions will resolve. Um. Is that the experience
that you have to,</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yes. And I
think the, you know, this, they fall into a similar management pattern,
is the blunt carotid injuries. Um, maybe not quite the same because
their natural history is a little different, but, but I think the, you
know, as far as serial imaging, um, management with, , either expectant
medical management for burn for those that are, that are less severe,
and then endovascular management.</p>
<p>Um, with those that are more severe, I think, you know, in a way, they
do fall into a [00:28:00] similar management pattern. And yes, , the
majority of those that, , that are low grade do resolve for or become
asymptomatic over the long period. Meaning they may, the receivable may,
may, if it’s thrombosis, I mean, oftentimes that does not result in.</p>
<p>Stroke. It just, depends, you know, but many of the smaller injuries
certainly do resolve over time. , and, and that can be seen with the
serial imaging approach that we’ve already talked about.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> So Dr. Rasmussen, um, Kevin
mentioned that a lot of these vertebral injuries, especially if they’re
kind of high up. In the neck or the skull base are managed by neuro IRR
or conservatively, but if you need to expose the proximal vertebral
artery in the neck, what’s your approach for that surgically.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Right? So
that’s a, that is exposed through a supraclavicular incision. Um, and
for those who have, um. Looked at up or [00:29:00] performed, um, a
carotid subclavian bypass, for example, or the, the exposure of the
subclavian artery. Most mostly that exposure, or most commonly that
supraclavicular incision is, is described for exposure of the, the, of
the subclavian artery.</p>
<p>Um, but through that same supraclavicular exposure, um. No, the
vertebral artery can be found a little bit more proximal on the
subclavian artery. So that’s, that’s sort of the, that’s the, that’s the
incision or approach. Um, and you know, it depends upon the, you know,
one, um, you know, what one is operating for, if it’s, if it’s for, for
bleeding and the intent is to, to control bleeding or ligated, that’s
actually most commonly.</p>
<p>The case, I mean, is, is that, , you know, that exposure is then used
because it’s a hematoma and, and there’s, , there’s bleeding. Um, you
know, then the intent is to expose, , um, the, the vertebral is, it
comes off of the, the subclavian and to [00:30:00] litigate it, it’s
rare that one would be repairing or trying to restore flow in the
setting of trauma.</p>
<p>Um, to the vertebral artery, you know, through that incision. We don’t
really typically do for Teebo reconstructions for trauma. typically if
you’re doing it through an open operation, it’s really to control
bleeding and, and, , probably gonna end up lying eight in it, just
because a re implanting the vertebral, you know, on the common carotid
or doing some sort of achievable reconstruction is just not well suited
for for the trauma situation, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Yeah. And one
quick thing before we move on, I just wanted to touch you on a paragraph
that I took from your book. Um, that I think is really important because
we don’t do. Artery exposure as much. I’ve only really done one in
fellowship. I’ve been a lot of credit subclavians where I see it, but an
actual exposure for TB and your book, it mentions you go in between the
two heads of the SCM.</p>
<p>Um, you open up the credit chief and you retract the carotid
immediately, and this will you, then you’ll be able to identify this is
a critical [00:31:00] structure of the vertebral vein, which directly
posterior, which is directly posterior to the carotid. And this
vertebral vein is sort of a landmark that helps you identify the
vertebral artery and the proximal subclavian artery.</p>
<p>And the one of these that I’ve done that was exactly the, um, anatomic,
exposure</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. Good
point. We didn’t tie, I didn’t talk about the anatomy or the specific
anatomical aspects. That’s exactly right. I mean, I think one of the
things, a couple of things that are useful in addition to to the
vertebral vein, I think that, um. I think that identifying, the sternal
head and the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid, you know, and
trying to find it really in a lot of ways, you can go between those two
heads of the sternocleidomastoid.</p>
<p>Um, and it’s in that sort of, that groove there where one can, um, and,
and oftentimes that’s just a, I mean, it is, there’s an open plane there
between the, and if you can look at your anatomy book, kind of get that
out and see the. The sternal head and the clinic killer had, , really
the window there, um, lead you then, you know, to that area where
posteriorly, there [00:32:00] will be the, the vertebral artery will
come off.</p>
<p>And so claiming, um, you know, you can feel the carotid, um, and it’s
just beyond, um, it’s just beyond the takeoff, at least on the right is
just beyond the takeoff of the carotid artery.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Great. And now
that we’re kind of talking about operations and we’re going to keep
diving into penetrating injuries of the neck. So dr , we just want to
just kind of start with some of the basics, , when we’re talking about
the zones of the neck, , and, and what are the anatomic considerations
of each of these zones.</p>
<p>Um, can you just tell us what zone one is and kind of what you’re
thinking of if you hear of a vascular injury in this area?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, so, you
know, so zone one, so the zones of the neck, you know, really, um, refer
to the, um, the anterior, um, aspects of the neck. Um, and so the, the
sort of the anterior triangles of the neck, and, um. The zone one really
is, is the most proximal. It’s the inferior, , aspects of the, um, , of
that, of that.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> So doctor asked
me, he said, I think we’re going to dive now into penetrating carotid
trauma and start with sort of the basics, , diving into the zones of the
neck and some of the things you take into consideration with each of
these zones in the neck as far as getting control.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> So um, the
zones of the neck, um, that are, have been used to help us
conceptualize, um, you know, penetrating injury mostly. . Oh, really?
Apply to the anterior portion of the neck. , kind of the anterior
triangle of the neck. Um, zone one is, is the, is the, , is the sort of
the first and the most, I guess.</p>
<p>Um, proximal zone, and it’s really defined, um, by the sternal notch to
the cricoid cartilage. So it’s a tight or narrow zone that really
involves the thoracic outlet. Um, zone two is the cricoid cartilage to
the angle of the mandible, which is, um, sort of the largest of the, of
the three zones, , in the [00:33:00] neck, the intern neck.</p>
<p>And then zone three is from the angle of the mandible to the base of the
skull. Like, zone one’s on three’s pretty tight. Um, there’s not a lot
of space there. Um, and those zones, um, I think are useful and that
have been described. , there was original paper led by, um, dr rune, R
O, N, H, J rune, and, , , in the journal of trauma in 1979 that, first
described those, those zones, um, it was called evaluation and treatment
of penetrating cervical, , injuries and in those zones I think are
really useful just as a, to help us conceptualize into, to try to, ,
manage, different forms of penetrating injury or different areas of
penetrating injury.</p>
<p>Um, so those are the zones. , I think that. You know, teaching, , at
least over the years has been the, penetrating injuries to zone one and
zone three largely, um, require, you know, imaging at the outset. Um,
and maybe either non-operative repair or at least imaging first with, ,
because they’re very difficult areas to expose penetrating injuries to
[00:34:00] zone two.</p>
<p>Um, traditionally have been in the teaching has been that those are all
managed with, , an open operation and exploration of the neck.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Um, and then for
zone three, sort of, I think, much like zone one, , we depend on sort of
imaging and angiography, , for treatment of these injuries. kind of want
to dive straight into this and, , discuss how do we manage credit
injuries. So we’re, we’re going to just pitch some scenarios at you and
we, can discuss some of the nuances of it.</p>
<p>Um. If you have a penetrating carotid injury, um, zone two, , and the
patient is neuro intact. Um, I mean, it’s this kind of the most
straightforward situation. But, , I guess, I guess a better question to
you is, is , if they’re neurologically intact, how do we determine
whether or not you’re going to repair the credit injury</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. I well,
I think probably the case-based scenarios are probably best because. You
know, each management, um, as I mentioned, the zones are there to
provide some conceptualization, help us to categorize our management.
But, , the, management of any given cases is often, individualized.</p>
<p>So in this particular case, yes, I mean, whether or [00:35:00] not
they’re, um, neurologically intact certainly matters. Um, I think with
penetrating zone to injury, um. I would still operate on that. I think
that, that, that, um, I think that paradigm is changing with modern
imaging technologies, CTA mostly, um, and clinical experience.</p>
<p>But I think that teaching is in the case that you’ve presented a
penetrating zone to neck injury with a carotid or penetrating zone to
wound with a carotid injury, then that patient would be. Operated on
with an open operation.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> the neurodeficit
portion of it, um, you know, historically there was concerns over if you
repair this carotid injury, um, you know, that you could create
intercranial hemorrhage. So, say you have a patient that comes in with a
zone, two injury with, , you know, on the right neck with. Left-sided
neuro symptoms. Um, w what are your thoughts on that? Does, does the
neuro status play into it or do you repair, the carotid.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, I think
that, and these days, you know, as I mentioned or alluded to, we have
the benefit of CT imaging. So, you know, the, the [00:36:00] paradigm of
that was. I mentioned the, AGA rune paper from 1979 and that really set
up the, the zones, you know, that was in really, um, that was in an era
where we did not have, and for many decades after that, we didn’t really
have the benefit of routine high quality contrast CT imaging.</p>
<p>Today we’re operating in that, , in this new era with. Routine, high
contrast or high quality contrast CT scan. So, um, I think in your case,
you know it, if the injury has a CT scan, um, which is likely to have
these days unless the, unless the injury was associated with bleeding
and the patient was just taken immediately to the, or, you’re going to
have a CT image.</p>
<p>If the CT image shows. You know, a grade one type of injury, you almost
extrapolating the, you know, the, the blunt characterization or the
blunt categories. If it’s zone one, then I suppose, you know, those may
also, you know, may not choose to operate on those, but I think
penetrating wounds, I would, [00:37:00] I would operate on them and I
think, um.</p>
<p>No. Cause I think they’re going to evolve. And they, the other thing
about exploring zone to the neck is that you can explore for other
Aerojet aerodigestive injuries. I mean that, that’s the other dictum or
part of this is to make sure that there’s not an injury to the, to the,
, to the airway or to the esophagus, as, as, as you perform the zone to
neck exploration.</p>
<p>So, um. You know, I think that they get, , an exploration. They get a,
you see the carotid, , and , , you explore and you see the injury and
then you manage it depending upon what the injury looks like at the time
of open exploration. I mean, it’s hard. I think it would be hard for me
to sit on a penetrating zone to wound that has a.</p>
<p>Carotid injury, I, it’s potentially described. Um, , and I think, um,
but I think, um, there’s a couple of reasons that I would err on the
side of, of operating on that.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Yeah. And I
think, , historically, they talked about, like I mentioned, the
intercranial hemorrhage. So if you had, say, a, , a very, , beat
[00:38:00] up looking carotid artery, um, or maybe. near thrombosis that
they would leave it, um, because they’re afraid of reproducing the
brain, causing intracranial hemorrhage.</p>
<p>But it seems like the consensus now, at least from your book and the
East guidelines is, to repair these deficits, , or to repair these
credit injuries because the mortality and final nerdy neuro status, ,
has been shown to be better in these patients. even if they started with
a neurodeficit.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> And I think
that we, you know, as vascular surgeons who do carotid endarterectomy, ,
routinely, I think we’re more so, I don’t, I do not. So, first of all,
this is a complex, . Complex scenario. So I, I’m definitely won’t throw
shade on any previous experiences with this sort of heroin, um, injury
pattern.</p>
<p>I do think that we, um. You know, for those of us who manage and perform
carotid endarterectomy routinely, we sort of are, are familiar, I guess,
when maybe not good with it, but we’re at least familiar with trying to
mitigate hyperperfusion syndrome or reprofusion syndrome. And I think
that is, um, you know, that’s just part of the, the management.</p>
<p>There’s the technical management of the injury, and then there’s the
communication with anesthesia to try to lower the blood pressure and the
overall profusion pressure. Um, in these patients after you repair the
carotid, um, it’s not unlike communicating with anesthesia about
resuscitation, right?</p>
<p>We need to, communicate with anesthesia in this case, to mitigate
hyperperfusion or reprofusion and worsening of a brain injury. We, we,
need to, , [00:39:00] communicate with anesthesia as well as do a good
job of fixing the, the injury.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> That is a great point. Um, what
about in a situation where you have a patient who has a large infarct.
On the same side as a carotid injury. What is your approach in that
situation?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. So I
think, um, you know, and it depends upon the injury. you know, I think
if this is a penetrating zone to wound. Um, you know, in nearly all
instances, you know, so you’re going to explore it. Um, because it’s his
own two neck injury. Um, I mean, I, I think, um. You know? Okay. So
there may be some that are, that are sort of there.</p>
<p>I’m trying to avoid the words. It depends. Um, you know, I suppose there
are some minor penetrating injuries where the, the image, , you know,
it’s a small stab wound or ice pick type of thing. , in, in, in,
there’s, there’s, there’s no hematoma. It’s looks like there’s a injury
to the carotid. That’s, , that’s, that’s, .</p>
<p>, resulted in, , in an infarct or a stroke, but there’s no bleeding or
pseudo aneurysm. Um, there might be scenarios where you would observe
it. I, I don’t, that’s not a practice that I, a spouse. I would explore
all of these. I still sort of fall, fall back on exploring all
penetrating zone two injuries. Um, and in that case then you’re going to
be in the neck anyway.</p>
<p>You’re going to see the injury to the carotid. And I guess your
question. Nicole is in the setting of an infarct, would you then repair
the carotid? Um, I mean, your options are either to repair it, do
nothing to it or, or lie gated and I guess as a vascular surgeon, um,
you know, I would repair it. Um, I think observing [00:40:00] it while
you’re there looking at it is then you risk it evolving into a pseudo
aneurysm and you having to re operate on it, you know, days or weeks
later.</p>
<p>As it is, the small injuries of all. Um, and I think, you know, the, the
question of, well, if he’s already at the patient already has an
infarct, would you like it? Um, I think that that don’t, that’s just not
something that is a vascular surgeon, um, that, that I would pursue. I
think, um, um, I would try to, , I would try to repair the injury
reperfused the hemisphere.</p>
<p>Um, acknowledged that, yes, you could make things worse with
reprofusion. but, , you also may take up a number that was ischemic and
you may reproduce it and, and push the penumbra in a positive direction.
So, you know, there’s not a lot of data in this area. And I mentioned
the word heroin. Um, you know, these are the most challenging of, of
injury scenarios for sure.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Definitely. Yeah.
there’s no easy answers there,</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> I mean, what
do you think, Nicole? What do you guys think and what’s your experience?
I mean, I, [00:41:00] I’m, I’m interested also in what you guys think
about that case.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> I have one
experience with this. It was in residency. Um, we had a, a person that
was sleeping and, , a, a pressure washer guy came up to him and asked
him to move. He refused to move and they got in a fight and I got the
pressure washer straight to the neck. , tore open his carotid. They came
into the ER holding pressure on his neck and huge hemiparesis on the
contralateral side.</p>
<p>Um, in that case, we did repair the carotid, and he did have a dense
hemiparesis after the case. Um, you know, whether litigating would have
helped or not, you know, we don’t know, but that, that’s my, that’s my
one experience.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Um, I actually haven’t seen a
situation like this,</p>
<p>but it’s definitely a tough, it’s a tough situation. I think if you have
an injury that’s going to cause potential for bleeding or a pseudo
aneurysm. And the vessel is payment, then my [00:42:00] inclination
would be to repair it. Um, if you’re doing, if you have like an
occlusion of the artery, when you explore it, you know, say you try to
do a thrombectomy and you’re not getting any retrograde bleeding.</p>
<p>That might be a situation where I’ve considered ligating it, but these
are tough calls.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> I think
you’re, I think you’re spot on. And I think as surgeons, you know, at
you know, at some point, um, , you know, um, um, I won’t speak for other
of my colleagues. , and I’m not saying that we. Try to teach this mantra
to our trainees. But you know, sometimes what comes to mind is, well,
don’t overthink it. you’re a vascular surgeon.</p>
<p>You’ve explored a vascular injury. There’s a hole in the artery or
disrupted artery, do what we do, which is fix it. And, um, again, I
don’t mean to be, um, , overly simplistic. I’m not trying to be, um, ,
sarcastic, but I, I think we get to that point. Where you know you’re
going to have to fix it.</p>
<p>It would be very difficult to just not do anything. And I think, um, in
the case that you described Kevin, um, I think that’s important. You do
need to know going into these, that the outcome’s going to be likely to
be stroke. You know, whether you make the stroke better or worse, um,
you’re not [00:43:00] really going to know by fixing the artery.</p>
<p>Um. And so the outcome’s going to be pretty bad. , either way, I think
that’s important for family and the patients and, for the care team to
recognize. Um, these situations, but, um, to me fixing it as, unless
Nicole, you bring up a good point. If the carotids occluded, then yeah,
I think then that is a time when I would like eat it.</p>
<p>And I think this is where we fall back on our experience with carotid
endarterectomy and managing, you know, a string sign that we thought was
there from a carotid occlusive disease. And you explore the string sign.
And by the way, the carotid was occluded. In those cases, in a setting
of a carotid endarterectomy, we actually likely ligated.</p>
<p>, and so I think we fall back on some of the similar principles that we
pursue and we’re fixing age related carotid disease.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Definitely, , and
for completeness sake, there’s another large. That’s hole in the neck, ,
that we encounter injuries to, , what is your thought on, , internal
jugular injuries? , can you like eight one, two, or</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, I
think, , I mean, you certainly can. [00:44:00] One can certainly, um, ,
like eight, these I think, um, um, and not have. Um, consequential
effects in most patients. Um, internal carotid arteries that are, I’m
sorry, the internal jugular veins that I have repaired have been in the
situation of a significant TBI.</p>
<p>So a patient has, you know, um, , bleeding in the neck. You explore,
explore the. the neck and the patient also has a penetrating wound to
the head and intracranial hypertension and, you know, needed a
decompressive craniectomy or something. in those cases, I have repaired
the internal jugular vein to maintain venous outflow of that side of the
brain.</p>
<p>Um, you know, I’m never sure whether or not that is necessary, but, um,
you know, I think it, it makes sense to me. I think, . In one case, I
remember before I repaired the internal jugular vein, you know, we
transduced a venous pressure, , towards the cranial side, and the venous
pressure was, you know, 40 or 50 millimeters of mercury, and there was a
gradient, right?</p>
<p>Eight millimeters of [00:45:00] mercury on the, on the cardiac side, or
the proximal or central side. So to me, if there’s a gradient, um, and
the patient’s got a TBI. Um, you know, I think fixing it is at least
reasonable. but most of the time you can lie gate, the external jugular,
, the internal juggler.</p>
<p>Um, and there’s enough collateral, venous drainage that, , the patients
will do fine.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay. So going back to repair
of the carotid artery and these, , trauma situations. So, you know, we
fall back on the standard steps that we use in, um, you know, other
types of vascular surgery. , the first thing being getting proximal and
distal control. And then Dr. Rasmussen, can you speak to us about
heparin ization and how you manage that in the trauma setting?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. I think
this is, I’m in this injury pattern more than, um, more than most or
more than any other arterial injury pattern. You, you’ve, you have to
use heparin in these cases. So, um, you know, it’s a, , in some injury
patterns, you kind of have to be ready for a wild ride. Because because
you explore the neck for bleeding [00:46:00] in a, and if the patient
has poly trauma, there’s bleeding elsewhere.</p>
<p>Um, and now you’re going to fix the carotid artery, , in some manner.
You’re going to either put in a shunt or, or just repair it primarily,
or you’re going to have to, if you’re going to clamp the carotid artery,
, in my experience, you’re going to need to use heparin. And so what I
mean by a wild dried is, you know, you’re.</p>
<p>Explore the patient for bleeding, they’re already bleeding. And now what
do you do? You give more heparin. Um, the key there is to try to fix the
carotid is, you know, as quickly as you can, , try to manage the, the
other areas of bleeding while the patients have denies. Um, and then,
you know, bring them off of pepper and after the carotid is repaired.</p>
<p>I think unlike, for example, I think there’s extremity arterial injuries
that can sometimes be managed without heparin. But I think if you’re
going to go to the trouble of, , in the, in the, in the technical, um,
challenge of, fixing a traumatic carotid injury, um, I think in nearly
[00:47:00] every case you got to give systemic, , heparin.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> so you know, you
have proximal and distal control. Now the patients have pronounced, um,
and how, how do you decide, um, whether to use a shunt or not and what
type of shot do you use.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. So, um,
you know, so the tenants are not, and so once you’ve done that, the
tenants are similar to other Cherrelle injuries. Um, you need to, um,
identify the injury and then. Remove the burden of thrombus. Often that
can be done with flushing, you know, back bleeding of the internal
carotid or back blading and for bleeding.</p>
<p>And then, passage of a thrombectomy catheter, obviously passing a
thrombectomy catheter up. The internal carotid needs to be done. Um, you
know, very carefully. It’s usually a two or three Fogarty catheter and
just a centimeter two. You really don’t want to be putting a Fogarty
catheter. Distill into the internal carotid more than a centimeter too.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can rely on back bleeding, you know, and back bleeding
from that internal can quote unquote blow out any thrombus that’s there.
Um, same with the proximal, but do [00:48:00] be aware that you need to
get rid of the thrombus burden in those arteries before you fix them.
Um, whether or not to use a shunt, I mean, I think in most cases of
trauma, um.</p>
<p>I, I have to say that I do not use a shunt, um, because it’s, it’s too,
um, it adds just another level of complexity to a case that’s already
complex. Um, and if I were to use a Shaunte, I would use either an
Argyle, Sean’s or a short son. Shant, S U N D T. , or the Argyle.
Shawn’s. I think it’s reasonable to do that.</p>
<p>Um, let’s say you’ve got a long segment, um, the loss of the carotid
artery, you’re going to need to do an interposition graft, let’s say.
Um, and, and in that case, you, you know, you’re going to have to go
harvest vein. Um, um, you know, in those cases, I suppose, sure. It’s,
it’s reasonable in those cases to put in a shunt to reproduce that
hemisphere of the brain.</p>
<p>, while the conduit is, is harvested or prepared. Um, so certainly there
are times when I have used a shunt in the setting of trauma, but, um, I
always also, I also try to keep in mind [00:49:00] too, in the case of
carotid trauma, to try to keep it as simple as possible. Keep in mind,
um, That the internal carotid can also be transposed over onto the
external carotid artery as a transposition.</p>
<p>You know, in some cases, depending upon the precise location of the
injury, so that, you know, you don’t need an interposition graft. And in
those cases, you know, you would not use a either. Um. So, you know, I
think, yeah, be, be mindful to use the shot and be ready, sort of think
about it, but also, um, if you find that fixing, it sets up pretty
quickly, either with an interposition graft or with a carotid
transmission transposing the internal onto the external.</p>
<p>If that sets up pretty quickly, , I do not think you should feel
obligated to use a shunt in the setting of trauma.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay. Great. Um, so. Options
for repair dictated somewhat by the injury and the size of the injury.
Um, you mentioned harvesting vein. Um, I think that’s a good point,
especially in cases where you’re [00:50:00] exploring the neck and
there’s also an aerodigestive injury, um, in order to avoid putting
prosthetic in the vein option is nice.</p>
<p>Um, what if you have a small injury and you’re just planning to do a
patch?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> So, For the
patch, I would either use, , personally, I would use Dacron or, , um, ,
bovine pericardium. You know, I think something, some prosthetic that’s
available, , you know, hemophilia Dacron patch, , or bovine pericardium,
um, as a patch. And I think, you know, you raise a really good point
there that I think if it’s, clearly a contaminated wound.</p>
<p>A penetrating wound where, you know, whether it’s because there’s an
injury to the esophagus or the airway, or it’s a shotgun wound, and so
there’s a large soft tissue injury or a fragment wound that’s really
contaminated. Then I think in those cases, yes, I think efforts to
harvest vein sappiness Maine probably, are advised, um.</p>
<p>I will say that if it’s the opposite of that, if it’s sort of a simple
penetrating wound, there’s no evidence, at least overt evidence of
aerodigestive injury. There’s no really other contamination. Let’s say
it’s a stab wound. , , you know, and it’s not a big [00:51:00] soft
tissue all quickly, , also use, , , Dacron or PTFE and, or position
graft and not use the, um, as I mentioned before, I think, um.</p>
<p>You know, you try to be mindful of keeping these operations, um, you
know, as, as, , expeditious as possible. You try to move them along.
And, um, in the case where there’s not a lot of contamination, um, or
any contamination, um, I also will then not use me. You know, I think, ,
, using a Dacron interposition graft or PTFE in this larger vessel,
these common carotid is, .</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay, great. Then I think one
important point also to mention is that you need to debris back any
devitalized tissue. Um, so you know, if there’s a defect in the artery,
but the tissue around it is pretty ratty. You know, you may have to
actually debried it back and make the defect larger initially before you
repair it.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Really good
point. Yeah. This ma’am. And the same with us, Sean. That’s why. You
know, I said, be ready to use a shot. [00:52:00] Certainly in some
situations you need to use a shun, but you know, using the shot, you can
also, , either create a concrete, you know, an injury or cause you to
need to debris the artery back a little further.</p>
<p>Um, so really good point.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> , start, you’re
asking some, one point that I picked up from reading your chapter here
is that, , we’re talking about back bleeding from the internal carotid
and it made the point of back bleeding is restored. , you should perform
an interrupt angiogram. To document complete evacuation of distal
thrombus.</p>
<p>Um, can you just speak to this.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. I
think, a completion study, um. Um, is is definitely, , something to,
consider or to perform. Now, I think we’ve used the, we’ve, we’ve used
the phrase during our discussion here this afternoon, , a luxury. You
know, there’s some of these things that you have the luxury to do. You
know, in some cases of trauma, you, may not have the luxury to perform.</p>
<p>an on the table. Arteriogram so, um, in those cases, I would use duplex,
, if you have duplex or even, use , the, [00:53:00] duplex function of,
the ultrasound that you have in the, or to show flow. Um, you know, and
then the, the most simple thing is a continuous wave Doppler.</p>
<p>And so some form of assessment of your repair certainly is indicated.
Um, the complexity of that completion exam depends on what. Capabilities
you have and how the patient’s doing. Um, so certainly in an ideal
situation, you’re fully outfitted. You’ve got, , experienced colleague
or partner or fellow with you, and, um, you know, the patient is on the
right imaging table and you can do a completion arteriogram then
absolutely.</p>
<p>I would, , put a, 18 gauge butterfly in the common carotid artery. Make
sure it’s. The aired so that you don’t inject air and shoot a completion
arteriogram, , both the repair and the distal internal carotid to assure
that there’s no thrombus in situations where you’re not that outfitted
and you don’t have that luxury then using a duplex ultrasound.</p>
<p>Um, I think is, [00:54:00] is fine. And in those cases, you don’t have
duplex or the patients just, . , has enough injuries that are in his, in
a complicated enough situation using a continuous wave Doppler and, and,
and just, finishing up is also</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> I’m curious. Dr. Rasmussen, do
you use a completion imaging study for elective carotid repairs?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> At this
point? Um, yeah, we use, , ultrasound. We use duplex ultrasound, but not
arteriography. I mean, I think that the arteriography point is, , is
useful. I appreciate that. And, , I think, for those who have done that
before and are used to doing it, it’s reasonable. The, the counter to
that would be, well, let’s say you see a little bit of thrombus. in the
distal internal, beyond your room repair, what are you going to do about
it? so it, it’s not to make light of or diminish the need for,
confirming a technically adequate or perfect repair. but I think,
[00:55:00] to some of my previous comments, you know, we as surgeons, I
think, try to strike this balance between, I mean, um.</p>
<p>You know, being perfect and then spending too much time overthinking it
and, , , carotid angiography completion angiography in the setting of
trauma may just not be feasible in a lot of cases. Um, or people may not
have the experience in doing it.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Right. Okay, so what if there’s
a concomitant tracheal or esophageal injury? Do you do anything</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Well, I mean,
I think we, we didn’t mention the word, we didn’t mention drains. So,
you know, in all of these cases where we’ve explored his own to
penetrate a neck injury, those patients are all drained. , with, , you
know, for me, , , a seven millimeter flat JP drain or, or maybe more,
um, I guess that’s a great question.</p>
<p>I don’t know that there’s a situation where I really buttressed , or
done used any adjuncts [00:56:00] to cover my repair. Um, the
vascularity of the neck. Um, um. is good and if not, great. And I think
that helps. I think if you’ve drained the, , the, , the, the wound that
is also sort of a mitigating step.</p>
<p>And I’m not sure that I have buttressed, , or done anything, um, more
than that to protect the arterial repair. And maybe it’s because I’ve
not had any that have had. overt esophageal injury. They may be, you
know, micro injury or something like that. Small. do you think, Nicole?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> I’ve heard of using a muscle
flap to separate the. Esophageal injury from the arterial injury, but
I’m not sure if that’s always necessary. And I do like the idea of the
drain, because that would prevent any</p>
<p>collection from building up there that could compromise your</p>
<p>arterial repair.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> I think that
those are both. Good points. I think the drain is in my mind, the drains
of mosque. Even if you explore the zone too. Yeah. You still know,
[00:57:00] because remember many of this opera deal injury, you just not
going to see, and honestly. I don’t know that any of us are familiar
enough with exposing the esophagus, , through that wound, we, we may
sort of see the esophagus, and do the best we can, but many of this off
the GL injuries will be pretty small, um, or we may not see them.</p>
<p>, so I think that, , the drain is a must, , in these injuries, at least
one and a muscle flap, I guess is something to consider if there’s gross
contamination. You know, either spillage from a softened geo wound or
they’re just gross contamination, the wound.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Well, Dr.
Rasmussen, once again, . We’ve covered a lot of topics in one session
and we really appreciate your expertise and insight</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Well, it’s a
pleasure to, to have the discussion with you this afternoon, and, um,
and I hope that it’s useful to, to you and to your listeners. I know
it’s been useful for me to run through a lot of these scenarios with you
this afternoon, so [00:58:00] thanks for the opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> And I think we
still have at least one more topic to cover in the future. endovascular
slash were boa management of trauma, if you’re up for it.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_uss.edu.individual:</strong> Sure thing.

<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> [00:00:00] Welcome back to behind the knife and
audible bleedings vascular trauma podcast series with Dr. Todd
Rasmussen. Today are in our final episode. We’re going to discuss the
endovascular management of acute vascular injury specifically. We’re
going to focus on. Thoracic , , blunt aortic injury and endovascular
treatment options for EXITO subclavian injuries.</p>
<p>Um, today we’re lucky enough to have Dr. Todd Rasmussen. He’s a Colonel
United States air force and his professor of surgery and an associate
Dean of research at the uniform services. University of health sciences
is an attending vascular surgeon at Walter Reed national military
medical center. Welcome back Dr.</p>
<p>Rasmussen.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Thanks very much. , Kevin for the opportunity I look
forward to. A good discussion on a, on a, I think a really important
topic. Thank you. Great.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> [00:01:00] And , , we also have Dr. Wayne Kasi. He’s
the chief of vascular surgery at San Antonio military medical center at
a level one trauma center in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>And he’s an associate professor of surgery at the uniformed services,
university of health sciences. So a welcome,</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> thanks, Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> All right , well, let’s just dive in. We’re going to
focus first on the blunt, thoracic aortic injury and the endovascular
management of that. So I think it’s important to understand.</p>
<p>how this occurs and what patients is occurs in. So blunt, thoracic Edric
injury is rare, but it’s very lethal. It’s less than 1% of all blunt
traumas, but it’s the second leading cause of death in blunt trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yes, Kevin, that’s why whenever I’m called about a
patient who has a blunt aortic injury.</p>
<p>I really want to know what their other injuries are because these are
usually very high velocity mechanism injuries, and there’s a particular
concern that they’ll have an intracranial injury.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Right. So, you know, when you’re the trauma resident ,
, taking pages, you know, the things you want to think about, that’ll
clue you into , , you know, we need to make sure they don’t have this as
a high-speed motor [00:02:00] vehicle collisions, motorcycle crashes
vehicle versus pedestrians and falls from Heights are some of the most
common causes of blunt, thoracic aortic injury.</p>
<p>Yeah, I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> it’s most vascular surgeons have seen. It’s pretty
amazing. Now the types of injuries people can survive. I mean, I’ve seen
people in cars who fallen over overpass, fallen off of overpasses people
being hit by trains, the prehospital management and the vehicle safety
features that exist now have really expanded what survivable.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. And , um, yeah. Quickly, we’re going to just
kind of review some of the anatomy of where these injuries occur is. Um,
so the aortic arch itself is relatively mobile. It doesn’t have a lot of
tethering, but the descending thoracic aorta itself is actually kind of
tethered. And so , , it’s it’s at that junction just distal , , to the.</p>
<p>Subclavian artery , um, is where these injuries generally occur. Most of
them curved within about a half centimeter to two centimeters of the
left subclavian artery. And so it’s at that junction that , , that the
aorta tears due to the deceleration. Um, so Wayne, do you have any
particular thoughts on the diagnostic methods for these?[00:03:00]</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Well, I think most trauma centers have a pretty good
protocol, such as the level one trauma center we work at. Typically the
patients who come in with a really high velocity mechanism, injury, get
a CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. And oftentimes if
there’s an extremity that’s injured as well, that’ll just be carried
down through the , , lower extremities as well, or the upper
extremities.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. Great. So yeah, CTA , um, is critical in these
patients , um, to help , , diagnose this. And so it’s important to
realize that , , patients with these injuries, the majority of them
greater than 75% never make it to the hospital. Um, and those that do
make it, the hospital are likely going to be severely injured and in
multiple other ways.</p>
<p>And it’s not gonna be an isolated injury. Um, so quickly, we’re just
gonna go over the SVS grading system. There’s a couple of ways to grade
these. The current one in the SVS is , , has four grades. The first one
is a grade one, intimal tear. Grade two is an intramural hematoma. Grade
three is a pseudo aneurysm.</p>
<p>So there’s an actual contour of the aorta is [00:04:00] disrupted. And ,
, and then grade four is what they consider rupture. So those are the
four SVS grading systems and , um, When do you want to talk a little bit
about how Dr. Starnes kind of breaks it down? Yes,</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Kevin that’s the official grading system. I remember
when behind the knife first started , , one of the first or second
episodes was an interview with Dr.</p>
<p>Ben Starnes. And I remember listening to his blunt, thoracic aortic
injury recommendations on the way to the hospital, as I would consult on
one of these blunt, thoracic aortic injuries. And he really categorize
these into three different categories based on his Harbor view data. ,
that was a minimal aortic injury , , which had a 10 millimeter or less
intimal tear, a moderate, which had a pseudo aneurysm.</p>
<p>And then the maximal, which I think he summed up very well and saying
that there was a unilateral, hemothorax active contrast. Extravasation a
periodic hematoma greater than two centimeters in maximum width. And
those were the patients that needed to go to the operating room,
basically at the time of the consult.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, that’s a great point. So the, [00:05:00]
the Dr. Star and slash Harbor view categorization is really just three
categories and they kind of depend on when you operate. So the minimal
ones you don’t operate on. Those are just the intimal tears, the
moderate ones. They need an operation, but not emergently.</p>
<p>And the Maximo ones need a, an emergent operation. And so I think that
was part of his kind of reasoning for it. One of the things</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> that. Struck me with that podcast on behind the knife
was he mentioned that what’s the point of having a grading system that.
Doesn’t have a treatment with each different grade.</p>
<p>And so as Kevin goes through these, you’ll see that there’s a little bit
of overlap between the two grades. And the point of that previous
podcast was if you’re going to have three treatments, then you need to,
which is imaging or surveillance , , delayed repair, and then urgent,
emergent, or urgent repair.</p>
<p>Then there needs to be three different grading scores,</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> right? Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think Dr. Starnes in
that , , the grading system, you mentioned, I always find it to be sort
of [00:06:00] practical,, , it’s very practical, , for, for us., the,
the four category classification is, is a little bit more technical and
maybe a little less practical, but , um, yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>I think it’s , , That’s true. You know, the other thing before we get
too far into this, I do think it’s useful for your listeners., , Kevin T
there, there’s a couple of classic, , um, you know, papers , , on. Blunt
aortic injury and , and, and they really speak to, for those who are
interested in vascular trauma, interested in this condition, I would ch
I would encourage you to dig into just two or three papers.</p>
<p>One of them is the original double AST paper led by Dr. Dimitrios and
the team at LA County in the late 1990s. Um, on blunt aortic injury,
which not surprisingly in the late 1990s, that double AST, what we refer
to as the WST one study showed that nearly all a blenny already injuries
were fixed with an open thoracotomy and clamping and sewing into graft.</p>
<p>Um, the WST [00:07:00] repeated that study about 10 years later and in
2006 , , or so I think it was actually published in 2008 , um, where
they , , double it’s called the double AST two study. So in the journal,
both of these were in the journal of trauma at the time. Now it’s the
journal of trauma and acute care surgery.</p>
<p>Again, led by Dr. Dimitrios says,, and, and in that 10 year period, the
management of blood aortic injury had completely. , evolved from open
repair to end a repair. And we won’t go into the details of those
studies, but , um, you know, and then you go three or four years later,
and now there’s the SBS that’s writing these guidelines.</p>
<p>So which you’ve seen in those three papers, the WST one in 1998 or nine
was T2. In 2008, both in the journal of trauma. And now the leading
organization writing the guidelines is the SBS and not the WST. What you
see there is this evolution of, of the management of this, , this,
injury pattern from open, you know, to [00:08:00] nearly exclusively
endo now.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, that is a fascinating evolution. Um, and very
interesting. I, I I’ve heard of those papers, but I didn’t realize the
transition from the, the trauma journal to the vascular journal for the
kind of guidelines on it. Um,</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> surprisingly again , um, at the risk of you guys not
inviting me back, I don’t mean to monopolize the conversation, but , um,
you know, the thing that’s happened with that evolution is the
mortality, the survival of, of operating on these, these injuries has
improved.</p>
<p>Rates of paraplegia have decreased blood utilization is decreased. You
know , patients, patients have a better chance in 2020 than they did in
2000, you know, and it’s largely because of the evolution to endo , ,
technologies that we’ve. We’ve mentioned, and I</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> bet there’s not a whole lot of other specific things
in trauma that have had that big of a change or improvement in outcomes
in that amount of time.</p>
<p>So it’s pretty, it’s actually pretty special kind of a pathology and
improvement there.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yes, sir. I [00:09:00] encourage one of your
listeners to write that up. It’d be a great review. , you know, two
decade review , , two and a half decade review of, of just the broad
strokes, how that practice has changed and how paraplegia rates are down
on mortality rates.</p>
<p>It’s still a highly lethal injury, but if patients make it to the
hospital, as you were referring to , um, modern grading, modern
management techniques, give them a much better chance.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Absolutely. And I, and I’ll include all those papers
in the show notes. So you can just go click the links in the show notes
here.</p>
<p>Um, we’re going to get back into the kind of management of this. Um,
there’s some things that all of these patients are going to need,
whether they’re going to get surgery or not. Um, you really want to
focus on anti impulse therapy. And generally you can do it with a beta
blockade and a short acting beta blocker is the best.</p>
<p>Um, so that’s going to be as small as generally the, the BA the beta
blocker of choice. And of course you have to talk with your neurosurgery
colleagues. Um, and we’re gonna discuss a little bit this more lately,
but. Um, you know, generally want the blood pressure less than 120
systolic. Um, it’s, there’s no guidelines on that, but it’s just sort of
consensus of, of surgeons.</p>
<p>But, you know, [00:10:00] obviously it depends on their head injury and
other what other issues they have going on. Um, and generally , , As far
as, you know, managing this small tears, the less than 10 millimeter
ones , , the guidelines recommend a CTA within 30 days. If you have a
larger flap, greater than 10 millimeters, this is something you’re going
to image sooner.</p>
<p>, generally within seven days. And as Dr. Kazi pointed out the other day
is that many of these patients are getting rescanned for lots of
different things. Reasons, whether it’s their blood organ , , solid
organ injuries and other things, and really kind of try and work it into
one of those or kind of fit the imaging , um, to help them out.</p>
<p>And then , um, if it’s an in, we’re gonna talk a little more about this
in detail, but if there is an external aortic contour abnormality,
generally, you’re going to repair that within less than one week. And
then of course, if the patient is hypotensive and has a hematoma , um,
concerning for a rupture, this should be repaired urgently.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> One of the things that comes up often I find is that.
Patients who ha who need to have their blood pressure elevated for one
reason or another such as a traumatic brain injury. And if you go back
on the behind the knife conversation , um, a couple of years ago, this
[00:11:00] was really brought to life as if they need to ramp up the
blood pressure to treat intracranial pathology.</p>
<p>Oftentimes that’s going to require a very urgent repair , um, so that,
that blood pressure can be brought up because you will not be able to do
that anti impulse therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Dark there. Are you saying on the, if there is a grade
one injury , um, per the say either, either guidelines, the Starns or
the SPS guidelines , , that you would this, if, and they needed a high
blood pressure for their brain, you’d potentially , , repair it with a T
VAR.</p>
<p>, even though there is no pseudo aneurysm.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> That’s a great question. I think that Dr. Starnes
covered that a little bit and I’m not gonna speak too much on what he
said, but he found that the intimal terrors at 30 days in that podcast,
that they were not going to need to be re-imaged or repaired at all.</p>
<p>And so he put each of those patients on 325 milligrams of aspirin for 30
days and said in that podcast that he didn’t Ramage them. So in that
particular case, no, I would not repair an intimal. Tear. Um, but if it
was a [00:12:00] significant other type of aortic injury, I think I
would lean towards repairing that.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts, Dr. Rasmussen?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah , I, I agree. I think that , um, you know, the,
sort of the grade ones that, , the, the , um, Seattle group has
described,, I, I, I don’t think that they , um, You know, parsed out the
patients who might, for example, need a higher cerebral profusion
pressure. And therefore they, they’re not as amenable to , , you know,
anti impulse therapy or hypotensive, resuscitation, whatever.</p>
<p>I don’t think they really parse that out, but I don’t. I also don’t. I
also don’t think that they, you know, they th th that they recommend or
others around the country recommend, you know , um, Fixing grade one
injuries in, in those patients. I think that they’re, if they’re grade
one , Um, they, you know , those, those generally don’t need to be
treated.</p>
<p>And , , now, I mean, I think there’s always room as in all of these
complex situations for,, for, for another CT, you know , for, for a
followup CT to see, I mean, if , , if a provider’s really nervous about
it and , , you know, the. The neurosurgeons have had to drive up the
pressure for the [00:13:00] TBI or, , to, to maintain, , , CPP then,
then , um, you know, you can always image them again to confirm that.</p>
<p>But , , I agree. I think if, if they’re a grade one injury , um, right
now they, they, you know, non non-operative therapies is safe and
indicated.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Great. So let’s talk a little bit more about the nitty
gritty of actually repairing these things. It’s important for , ,
residents out there to understand , , the T-bar devices that are
currently in the market.</p>
<p>Um, these are generally designed for aneurysmal disease and not for the
trauma population. , the Trump populations going to be smaller. They’re
going to be , um, Younger and healthier vessels and it’s , um, you know,
these devices weren’t really made. So the devices that we currently
have, they are, you know, generally require large diameter , , access.</p>
<p>Their compliance is not , , as ideal for these kinds of , , smaller
aortic arches. And the actual size of the devices are relatively large
compared to these aortas. Um, the average size of the aorta proximal to
the injury in a study was shown to be about 19 millimeters. And our
current smallest [00:14:00] device is about 22 millimeters, which is,
you know, an adequate oversizing, but you wouldn’t, you know, that’s , ,
only, you know, wouldn’t want much bigger than that.</p>
<p>So , , Dr. W what is your experience with the current generation of
devices?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, I think the good news for a lot of these devices
is that the technology seems to be advancing. To where arch confirmation
is starting to have a lot of technological advances so that the young
patient with the steep aortic arch will better be treated in the coming
decade.</p>
<p>Dr. Rasmussen, this always brings up an interesting question in regards
to, so the sizing of an Intergraph, so in a patient’s injured and
they’re in the trauma Bay and they get their CT angiogram. Oftentimes
they’re under resuscitated. How do you go about assessing what you think
is the proper size of the order and choosing your endograft.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> So I think , um, it’s a great question. And , um,
one of the things just to add to what you’ve, what you’ve said , , Wayne
is that , um, and it really, I think fits with our , um, the, you know,
the line of our discussion about the evolution of, , of, of, not of this
injury pattern. Now our ability to [00:15:00] have classifications that
are pretty technical , , with degree of injury.</p>
<p>then the evolution of. Of management techniques is now the evolution of
these stent graphs. And, you know , um, one of the, I think things to
keep in mind is that. TEVAR for blunt threat , um, thoracic
endovascular, aneurysm repair T VAR extent graft , , for blunt aortic
injury, you know, a decade ago was done with really very clunky
endograft technology and none of that technology.</p>
<p>Let’s say for the, for example, the WST two study that I cited , , the ,
the, the endovascular repairs in that study were often , , you know,
iliac limbs , , for the, you know, not really designed for, for blunt
aortic injury. Now, fast forward to 2020. And we have, for example , ,
one of the devices that is made by Gore is actually has an indication ,
, for , , an aortic transduction.</p>
<p>You know, and so now , , you know , the, the technology , , is really
evolved now to, to suit the, you know, the condition, which is sort of
exciting. And I think gives us as vascular [00:16:00] surgeons and, and
gives patients a lot better options. Um, maybe we can go over some of
the specific devices , , next, your point, or your question about , um,
you know, imaging is, I think is, is.</p>
<p>Is an important one for listeners to understand. And I think w just to
be clear, what we’re talking about is is that if , , if , , Patient’s
aorta is imaged in the cat scanner when his or her systolic blood
pressure is 90 and they’re relatively hypovolemic then, you know , is,
is the , , how accurate is it has a diameter of 18 millimeters, for
example.</p>
<p>And is that a vasoconstrictive or just a hypovolemic , , aorta. And I
think it is, I think that it is, it is, it is not the greatest , ,
measure and that providers should To keep that in mind that when
patients are resuscitated, that the diameter of the aorta is actually
going to be larger. So usually what I would recommend is to , um, you
know, still oversize, , the, the stent graft by, you know, 20% or so
based on your original measurement , , again and here , , unlike
aneurysm disease [00:17:00] where you know, you’re trying to.</p>
<p>I think get a seal and it really diseased , um, and dilated aorta here.
, you know, the seals zone in, in the, in the pathology is, is almost
always much more focal. You’re really just trying to cover and seal the
proximal intimal tear. Um, and so I think that, you know, oversizing by
roughly 20% , um, Using intravascular ultrasound or IVUS, I think is
also useful.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you get them, the patient to the, or for the TVR, for the
thoracic endovascular repair, using intravascular ultrasound real time
to confirm or refute your original , um, you know, your original CT scan
is. Is , , is also useful. Um, but I think keeping in mind the blood
pressure and their volume status when the scan was taken oversizing by
somewhere around 20 to 25% and then using IVIS.</p>
<p>So I think are useful tips. What do you think, or how do you guys do it
in San Antonio? Oh, that’s a</p>
<p>great</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> point. I mean , we, we set up IVUS for every single
aortic case so that it can be there. It’s mounted to the system and.
[00:18:00] Even if we don’t use it for the particular case, we know that
everything’s there and available for us to use it.</p>
<p>If we need to re image or resize and aorta or some other blood vessels
so that it can be adequately sized. I remember one time we had a 17 year
old with a blunt traumatic aortic injury and he needed an emergent
repair and we didn’t have the smallest endograft at the hospital, but
fortunately there was a one from a local hospital that could be sent
over, but.</p>
<p>That was a little bit of a troubleshooting. I was, what is, what was I
going to do as far as putting a larger endograft into a relatively
smaller we’re to knowing exactly what we talked about that open repair
has much worse outcomes than an endovascular repair. And I think my, the
way I was going to approach that one was I was going to use the IVIS
after I deployed the endograft to make sure I didn’t have a retrograde
dissection , , or something , , some major complication related to the
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, I think, I think that also , , Wayne speaks to
the,, um, the,, in, in some ways, and I, I don’t want this [00:19:00] to
be not, I don’t want to overstate this, but in some ways this condition
is , um, although the overall patient complexity can be a much greater,
some ways, just the aortic. Pathology is simpler than, than a complex
dilated aortic aneurysm and in an elderly patient.</p>
<p>And, and I think that makes it more amenable to,, , to , um, you know,
sort of belts and suspenders repair, meaning that you just really need
to seal the, the entry point. I mean, again, it’s not, I’m not trying to
oversimplify it because it is serious. And these certainly , , some of
these, a grade three or four by imaging can certainly rupture and cause
mortality.</p>
<p>But, but even in the WST two trial in 2000, Eight that was published in
the journal of trauma, the success and the, in the unmistakable , ,
advantage of endo repair over open. That was all using very primitive,
endo materials, you know, as I mentioned , so, you know, I think,, ,
it’s really an exciting part of vascular , , practice mascular
[00:20:00] trauma is, is the evolution of , , of these technologies.</p>
<p>But , , I appreciate, and I agree with, and it definitely used them.
Belts and suspenders sorts of endograft that you got. It’s not exactly
the one you want. Um, but you use what you can and just try to seal the,
the proximal portion of the intimal tear.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. And , , you know, there, there’s a lot of
technical aspects of these and , , kind of , , you can miss , um, the
zone you can deploy to proximal, to distal.</p>
<p>One of the issues that comes up and you see sort of in a case reports of
, , you know, malpositioned , , devices is what they call bird beaking
and where the , um, the lesser curve, the graft isn’t. Approximated well
, um, to the lesser curve of the aorta and a doctor asked me, said, I
wonder if you had any tips for our listeners , um, on how to avoid a
bird beak.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah. Great question. A couple of things. Um, so I
wish we could , , illustrate this , , for your listeners. Um, you did a
nice job bird beaking to me and , , you know, you guys jump in or
correct me if you’ve got a different way to articulate it. On just
[00:21:00] a call. We don’t have a whiteboard , um, bird beaking, as you
said, is the, is sort of the lifting of the inferior aspect of the very
proximal.</p>
<p>, endograft where the fabric is. That that, that ring, if you will, of
stent covered stent lifts up off of the inner curve of the aortic arch.
And if it lifts up, then it’s prone to get an, a, you know, the jet of
flow and pressure that then, you know, would cause an endo leak. And so
to get that first covered stent ring to lay down , , so that it doesn’t
lift up and cause this, I guess the bird beat comes, cause it sort of
has this appearance of a.</p>
<p>I’m a triangle , , on the, on the imaging, I guess that’s where bird big
comes from. Um, to get that, to lay down a couple of things, one , um, I
think getting a stiff wire , um, , , around the outer edge of the art.
So using an Amplatz , , or a lender, Quist wire, that’s really , um, all
the way into the aortic root, the ascending aorta and actually
[00:22:00] pushing it.</p>
<p>Um, so that it’s got sort of a constant. Tension that , um, allows you
to get the endograft forward and, you know, making sure that you have a
stiff wire and platform. Is one, you know , that’s, that’s a basic
principle of endograft deployment anyway, independent of the bird beak.
But I think that helps. And then I think another is to consider if
there’s, if it’s close or if it’s an angulated arch to consider taking
the endograft over, across the origin of the left subclavian artery ,
um, to where the , um, You know, to where the there’s more room, if you
will, and a flatter inner arch or inferior aspect of that curvature to
lay the graph down.</p>
<p>So covering the left subclavian, using a stiff wire with forward
pressure on that wire during positioning and deployment. And then the
third thing, you know, some of the, the Gore , , conformable , ,
Thoracic Intergraph now actually has a kind of a ratchet on it that,
that allows one to have some control of that first stent so that you can
actually kind of conform or lay it down.</p>
<p>Um, I think that that’s real. Um, [00:23:00] I’m not quite sure how
effective, I don’t know what, you know, Wayne, what you think about the
conformable Gore graft, but I think that maybe another advantage that
comes as graphs that you can actually. Manipulate them when they’re in
place and try to lay down that first , , covered stent component.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Right? I, I think that’s ideal. I mean, we have
recently. Switched all our inventory. So we let the old stuff, you know,
use it or, or expire. And then everything that we purchased now for
blunt, thoracic aortic injury is conformable. And I like to use the
double curve Lundquist. And just like you said, I. I have the assistant
, , whoever’s holding the wire actually put forward pressure.</p>
<p>So that, that wire is really snugged against the greater curvature of
the order aorta. And also that the double curve lender request is
basically sitting at the , , at the heart so that it can really give me
as much tension as I can. And I think that bringing it across less of
cleaving, if you think it’s going to be bird beak is, [00:24:00] is.</p>
<p>Absolutely essential that if you need to cover it so that you don’t have
it sitting oddly on the inner curvature, that that’s ideal. And I agree
with you a hundred percent.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. So , , another kind of issue , , that we can
sometimes run into in our trauma patients is getting the devices there.
Um, some of the iliac arteries are , , relatively small.</p>
<p>Um, you know, granted the devices are getting smaller themselves, but
Dr. Rasmussen, do you have a size , , that you would consider doing an
Elliot conduit , , for these graphs? Is there kind of a rule of thumb
with our current generation?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> That’s a great idea. A great question. A great idea.
Sometimes to do it in Elliot conduit, if you need it.</p>
<p>I think , um, Boy, I hate to , , to wimp out and just say it depends.
Um, so I would say that, you know, if , if, if the iliac , um, but it
does, but it does depend , um, you know, it depends on the age of the
patient. I mean, if they’re calcium free , um, you know, it’s a young
patient, like many or most of our trauma patients , um, and the iliac
is, you know , um, Seven millimeters or greater.</p>
<p>Um, and it’s sort of a straight shot we’ll give it a try. seven.
[00:25:00] To eight millimeters is sort of on the small side of this.
Um, but I will often, but if it’s calcium free in, in a young patient,
then, you know, w w we’ll try it through the, through , , through the
femoral without a conduit.</p>
<p>Um, I think that if gets smaller than that, if it’s a female and they’re
hypotensive, when the images come through and you, you know, you’re
ultrasounding them in the, or using duplex to size up their common
femoral and you, you know, whether it’s shock or just they’re native,
they’re just small. If it gets to be, you know, less than six or seven
millimeters, then I think , , You know , , exposing either the common
femoral or the external iliac through retroparotoneil approach and
putting on a Dacron conduit is it’s easy enough , , and should be done.</p>
<p>Um, So it depends, but you know, the flip side, I guess , , Kevin is
that if it’s , , you know, if there’s a lot of calcium and it’s an
elderly patient and it looks like there’s atherosclerosis, then I have a
lower threshold to put on a conduit because you know, you could cause
problems. It’s not as accommodating of a passage of the sheet.</p>
<p>If they’re, if they’re calcified or [00:26:00] highly</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> ambulant, Yeah, I think if it measures seven on the
seat, the angiogram and the trauma Bay, that it’s likely, like you said,
if it’s not calcified and not diseased and not injured, otherwise it’s,
it’s a good chance that you’re gonna be able to deliver that endograft
without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Um, you may, I sometimes consider, I use do a most percutaneously, but
cut down on the femoral artery, just like you said, just to make sure
that it’s delivered safely. And if there’s a problem with removing it,
that I’m ready to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> I think that’s a great point. If it’s a small one
and you feel like you’re kind of right on that edge, then I have a low
threshold to just cut down.</p>
<p>And that way, you know, you afford yourself, I think a little bit , um,
more assured sort of placement sure. Placement with an open, which is
also relatively easy or should be, , to, to do it open the other. The
other thing, I don’t know if you’ve used, I sometimes will oil the
sheets with mineral oil, you know, I’ll put it on the.</p>
<p>On the , , I mean, you know, the other question here we haven’t really
talked about is heparin heparin eyes or not. We can get to that, but
sometimes I’ll get some mineral oil on the back, you know, and I’ll just
cover the sheath. If you think [00:27:00] it’s going to be tight and
sort of make that , um, make the sheath as you’re passing it from the
femoral up the, the small externally, like into the end of the AOR to
make it slick, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, you , , are reading our minds, sir. So I was
actually going to bring this question to Dr. Kazi. Um, many of these
patients are multi injured as we’ve discussed and have , , head
injuries, maybe even head bleeds. Um, do you recognize in all of these
cases, is there cases where you won’t</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> have her nice? Well, it’s interesting in our group, we
have a variation of practice patterns.</p>
<p>, I guess number one is if the neurosurgeon or someone. Completely
contraindicate you to using heparin. And then you’re a little bit in a
bind. I haven’t really found that to be largely the case, but it does
come up every now and then I personally like to Hep denies, even if it’s
just a little bit of heparin , um, 3000 of heparin, just to , , allow me
to have the optimal device, but I don’t think it’s necessary.</p>
<p>One of the things that you and I discussed recently because we repaired
A symptomatic AAA three days ago on a COVID positive patient. Kevin was,
we were concerned about the thrombosis [00:28:00] with the large sheets.
Um, Dr. Rassman, what do you think with the COVID patients , um, and
heparin in general , , do you, do you have denies all of your T VARs and
what ha what if you had a COVID positive patient?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> That’s a great question. I mean, I think , um, You
know , I, I remember , um, my first sort of TVRS for blunt aortic injury
when I was in San Antonio and I was amazed at , um, how. Um, if the
patient’s condition allows it , , and I think most of them do , ,
operative planning. So imaging , , trying to get some resuscitation,
maybe even, you know, a 12 to 24 hour delay and the repair.</p>
<p>If you get everything lined up and it’s a straightforward , , repair ,
um, how you, you can really get these stent grafts in and. Sort of 30
minutes or less. Um, I don’t, I don’t want to exaggerate or tell a fish
story here. So I , , you know, I know it’s never as quick as we surgeons
think it is, but the point is if you can get it done quickly and the
patient has other , , contraindications, a head bleed, solid organ
injury, you know, big hematoma and a fractured femur or [00:29:00]
something, then I think they can be done safely without heparin.</p>
<p>Um, and I think , um, one just needs to be mindful of the time. Um, and
then really flushing out the femoral and then assessing the access side
or site , , when you’re done. Um, so I think they can be done safely
without heparin. Um, now the, the flip side is if the patient has no
solid organ injury, TBI hematoma, and the thigh from a femur fracture ,
then, then proceeding with the use of heparin is it would be preferred.</p>
<p>You know, I think that’s always preferred. Um, so I think, you know, I
guess what I would say is I would prefer to use heparin. I do in all the
cases that I can , , but I don’t sweat it too much if I can’t, because
of other conditions, the patient has other injuries. I just am more
attentive to the time my sheets are in.</p>
<p>And then to what’s happened. What’s the status of the Elio femoral
segment. After I’ve removed the sheets. I think in COVID positive
patients, I think they’ve shown [00:30:00] themselves to be relatively
hypercoagulable and I would , , I would want to I’d, you know, I I’d
have a more , um, you know , , th I think the imperative to
anticoagulate coagulate, those patients would be higher because of their
, , shown propensity to develop , , thrombus.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, that’s exactly what Kevin and I did with that
endo AAA patient is we pepper to them more than we normally would. And
then followed act pretty closely to make sure they stayed over two 50,</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> a really good point. And we didn’t really mention
it, but the act, the activated clotting time, I think, you know, we
talked about operative planning and, you know, for your listeners, I
think.</p>
<p>You know, we tell our trainees the best, the best resident, the best
surgeons are pessimists. You know, it sounds bad. I don’t want to be a
downer before the holidays, but you have to anticipate things going
wrong and never be the optimist. Right. , if I have a major injury or
condition, I want my doctor to be worried that everything’s going to go
wrong.</p>
<p>, I’m exaggerating a little bit to make the point. The part of that is
the act machine. Like how many times have we been in the employment? And
we need an activated clotting time because we really, whether it’s for
carotid or endarterectomy or this type of an [00:31:00] injury, and you
know, the, our staff, our anesthesia colleagues, not necessarily to a
fault of theirs, they’ll say, Oh, we don’t basically team.</p>
<p>Machine’s not working. Or we don’t have it or something. Right. So part
of the pre-op planning for, for house officers is, you know, among all
the other things is where’s the act machine. And could we draw a test
act before the case starts because Dr. Kazi really needs the act on this
one. And , um, the last time you, you know, the worst time to hear ,
well, the act machine is not available.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work. Cause when you’ve got a, you know, an 18 French sheath
up a small iliac and an undergrad in the order, So I agree with the act
and , , I don’t want to sound too much like a pessimist. Maybe I’m just
a realist , um, that, you know, putting that on the pre-op timeout, for
example, if you’re going to do team steps or time out , , make sure that
you’re you’re you got that act lined up.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. , so there’s two kind of main points
we want to cover here , , to wrap up , topic. And one of them is the
subclavian artery. And as we discussed before, the average distance
between the injury and [00:32:00] a subclavian is about 5.8 millimeters.
And most of these devices recommend a two centimeter coverage and
healthy vessel.</p>
<p>Um, and then two centimeters distal in order to adequate coverage. so.
And , and, and using those numbers, the registry suggests about 40% of
patients have their subclavians covered in these cases. So, Dr.
Rasmussen, what are your thoughts on covering subclavian artery? Do you
, um, do anything to revascularize it AF if you do , , cover it and any,
any thoughts you have on this?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah. Great question. this also has evolved , , and
I think can be institution specific. Although I think most institutions
now have gone to not. ,, um, preemptively, revascularizing the
subclavian. So maybe for, if we take a step back , , I don’t want to
take too much time, but I think for your listeners, what we’re talking
about here is , is, is covering with that covered stent.</p>
<p>So you’ve got to get that covered stent graft up over. In into the
distal part of the aortic arch to seal to [00:33:00] get a good two
centimeter length of seal before that aortic tear that happened most
commonly at the aortic isthmus. Right. And so sometimes that requires
covering the left subclavian artery. And while that seems crazy, most
patients do just fine with that.</p>
<p>Actually they may have a little bit of arm claudication, but do just
fine. And what that allows us to do is to then get that two centimeters
of seal. , where the stent graph is really well. Well, opposed to the
inner curve of the aortic arch, if you will, , or, or the outer curve.,
the, the things that I think about, I think , , where’s the vertebral
artery.</p>
<p>So the, so the risks of covering the left side, Clarion, I mentioned arm
, , arm claudication , um, or Ms. Schema, so real close attention to , ,
and then another complication could be stroke. Right. So that , um, if ,
if, if the patient has, , , the dominant vertebral artery is on the left
and it comes off the left subclavian, and for some reason they don’t
have a right to vertebral, then you really need to revasc you’ve got to,
you can’t cover the left subclavian without [00:34:00] revascularizing.</p>
<p>Um, you know , um, that subclavian and the verge , um, so paying
attention to where the w what the, the dominant vert is, where it’s
from, what is the right vertebral artery look like? Is there
atherosclerotic disease in the arch and the great vessels to include the
birds? And then the third main complication is spinal cord ischemia ,
um, and weirdly , , you know, for your listeners, you think , well, how
can covering the left subclavian lead to spinal cord ischemia?</p>
<p>Um, and if you. Think back to how our spinal cord is perfused. Um, it is
rare in a very it’s uncommon , but, but there are collateral pathways
through the, through the Ima, the internal mammaries and to, through
other,, , collateral circulations that originate off the subclavian.
Whereas subclavian profusion can be important to perfuse the spine.</p>
<p>So, you know, Making sure that you have those three things in mind, left
arm, claudication, posterior circulation, stroke, spinal cord ischemia.
And as long as you have those front and center , um, you know, most of
the time you can still cover that left subclavian [00:35:00] without.
Revascularizing it. And you will be cognizant of the situations where
you do need to revascularize it either before you do the T bar or at the
same time.</p>
<p>Um, or sometimes afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, this is always an interesting situation,
particularly some more rare scenarios that often comes up as well as , ,
as you said, the right for T-ball already may be occluded. There’s a
dialysis access and the left arm or the one that concerns me the most is
if there’s a Lima to an LA , , I don’t, I agree. I agree.</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s an easy answer on these. , we have , , laser
finished rated a few endograft for these rare cases with pretty good
result. And I do think that there’s some graphs on the horizon. That’s
going to allow us to preserve that left subclavian artery , um, in the</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> future. Really good point about the Lima. So for the
listeners, that means that the patient’s had a cabbage and they’ve got
their eyes left. Ima going into the, for example, anterior , , or to
the, into a coronary. So you can’t, you know, you can’t cover that
without you might cause a M I, [00:36:00] And I think good point on the
future of the graphs, I think we do have already branch graphs that , ,
may not yet be approved for trauma, but they’re probably coming, which
will help.</p>
<p>And did we talk about, or maybe I’ll ask a question. I don’t know if
that’s fair. , , Kevin and Wayne, but did we talk about spinal cord
drainage? I mentioned, you know, spinal cord ischemia and a rare
incidence in paraplegia, you know, do you guys , , in San Antonio
preemptively , , do spinal cord drainage , , for blunt aortic injuries
that you’re going to put an undergrad in or not?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> , no. Um, in general, it’s thought that , , likely due
to the short distance of coverage with these graphs, that there’s not a
lot of , , intercostals that are kind of covered and putting the spinal
cord at risk. I think the, the risk of spinal cord ischemia is extremely
low in these cases, but it’s something you certainly.</p>
<p>Have to have in mind and have your anesthesia team or neurosurgery
colleagues , um, aware of and available for , , should the situation
change. And so certainly a motor in [00:37:00] neuro exam at the
conclusion of the case is critical. And I think we would respond , ,
with , , elevating the blood pressures and , um, you know, potentially
placing a spinal drain if there was concern for , , spinal cord ischemia
, , following the case, but , , routinely , , we do not.</p>
<p>um , And, and that’s sort of our kind of algorithm for that. How about
you, Dr. Mucin?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, I agree. I don’t have a whole lot more to add.
We do it selectively very uncommonly and that’s also because of the
risks associated with , , placing a spinal cord drain. You know, those
aren’t minimal both placing the drain and then monitoring it
effectively.</p>
<p>Um, I think we’ve got away from that. I think it is important for your
listeners to understand also that. And I think you referred to this,
that the risk of spinal cord ischemia, when you cover, you know, a
segment of the, of the, of the descending thoracic aorta, the risk is
low because we’re not paving the entire or such a long segment.</p>
<p>But the risk is , , you know, it’s out there for what, 24 hours, 48
hours. So there’s a rare, you know, again, thinking about being a
[00:38:00] pessimist , , I guess I should get away from that term. That
sounds bad around the holidays. I’m not trying to be , , but you know,
the resident’s house officers, you have to realize that, that the
patients who, for example, come out of the, or with a normal neuro exam,
there is an incidence it’s low to 3%.</p>
<p>But patients who can develop spinal cord ischemia like 24 or 48 hours or
even 72 hours later. So we really have to be mindful of, of the spinal
cord ischemia complication, even though it’s uncommon.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, I think the post-operative care can’t be
understated. The fact that you avoid hypotension, you make sure that the
patient’s properly resuscitated.</p>
<p>And if there is any concern for a neurologic , , event that’s occurring,
that you have a system in place to where a lumbar drain can be placed
relatively expeditiously. A couple of things that come to mind. When I
think about spinal drains, particularly for elective cases are someone
who’s had a priority repair , , Chronic [00:39:00] kidney disease to a
significant degree, stage four or five, or even in stage renal disease.</p>
<p>And , um, and whether I’m going to need to cover a large segment. And
luckily for most aortic injuries, you’re talking 10 centimeters for a
covered endograft. And so again, that’s going to be the, the shortest
device that’s available. And so it’s going to give you the lowest risk.
As far as an aortic coverage standpoint occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> those are great points and things to keep in mind when
, , fixing these patients. , so as we wrap up a blunt, thoracic aortic
injury, we’re going to cover one of the more important points. There’s a
lot of important points here. , but this one , , is the timing of the
repair. Um, You know, generally it was thought initially that, you know,
you should repair these sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Um, but Dr. Rasmussen, , what, what are your thoughts on the timing?
And, and specifically, I think we’re referring to the, kind of the, the
SVS grade three, the pseudo aneurysms, , what, what are your thoughts on
the timing of repair of these.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Um, so another great topic, great question in this,
, , pertaining to this injury pattern.</p>
<p>I think that , um, you know, I think that I’ll start with the premise
that [00:40:00] delayed repair is, is certainly feasible. Um, in many
cases and in. Many cases it’s preferable. And so , um, that’s sort of
the premise of , of, of the answer and delayed repair, meaning 24 to 48
hours later is feasible and preferable in many cases.</p>
<p>Um, I want to be careful because there’s certainly some cases , , where
it’s, you know , , a grade four or a grade three that’s, that’s evolving
into a four , , where the patient, you know, the delayed repair is not.
Feasible, , um, but I think that Delaine w what we’ve understood, I
think with our experience broadly on this , um, in the U S is that once
you get a patient under your.</p>
<p>Care in, into your ICU. If they have a grade three repair and they’ve
survived that far and you now can get them on anti impulse therapy, um ,
and, and appropriate resuscitation, that, that waiting 24 hours again is
safe and, and preferable. , and I think the majority of cases,, and, and
why is that?</p>
<p>Well, I think it’s because it allows us to do good. [00:41:00] Operative
planning. We’ve, we’ve mentioned sort of the team steps, if you will,
the things that we want to troubleshoot and anticipate for the repair ,
, whether it’s size of vessel access assembling the right endograft the
right team to include spinal cord drainage or what, you know, the whole
thing.</p>
<p>I think we do a better job. We’re giving ourselves 24 to 36 hours, for
example. And I think it also allows patients other injuries to be
stabilized. So whether that’s a serious TBI , um, you know, long bone
fracture, solid organ injury, , , I think it, it helps us. So , um, so I
think Delaine is, is , is, is feasible.</p>
<p>We’ve just published. I, we mentioned. Well mentioned a whole lot of
papers here, but , , there is a paper in the journal of vascular surgery
, , that is a large assessments and just came out in the journal of
vascular surgery, Ramon. , is the senior author, Dr. most of you know,
is that you, the university of Texas health science center, and it’s a
great paper for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>It’s, it’s the timing of repair for blunt aortic injuries. So it’s this
[00:42:00] paper addresses exactly your question. Um, it’s a great paper
cause it’s got a trauma and vascular surgeons on it. , Bryan Eastridge,
Don Jenkins are on it. , but it’s got some really , , awesome , ,
vascular surgery fellows from Cleveland clinic who did this when they
were in Cleveland.</p>
<p>, and what that analysis of the national trauma DataBank shows is, is
just that is that it’s actually a survival benefit associated with
delayed repair. Um, and I won’t go into the paper. Your readers can look
at JBS and, and Ramon, Dr. , , , is you can sort of pub met him, or we
can send that paper out on your, on your , , to your listeners , but,
but it does show that there’s a survival benefit for those who have a
greater than 24 hour.</p>
<p>, delay in their TVR. And that’s, there’s an analysis that we did in
that paper that, that controls for severity of injury, you know, meaning
that it’s not just because those with less severe injuries , um, survive
longer. there’s undoubtedly some survivor ship. Bias and that , ,
definitely acknowledged that, but it, but that paper speaks to its at
large NTDB [00:43:00] analysis of this injury and it speaks to the,
value of , of, of trying to delay repair if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s a really important , , topic , um,
to have published the data on, because I think many surgeons and ER docs
, and, and when they hear of a aortic transection or pseudo aneurysm
feel , um, and they may pressure , , vascular surgeons to, you know, get
in there and fix it. And I think , , knowing this information is
critical and supportive of our community.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> And the, and the delay also allows you to. Really get
an idea of what’s the constellation of the Andrew patterns that are
occurring. I mean , if, if there’s some infectious process that’s
concomitantly going on with the injured patient’s care that can an
infected endograft and the thoracic order can be a nearly.</p>
<p>If not insurmountable problem to try to tackle and , , repair. Um, we, I
can remember one case where the endograft was infected and before we
could even wrap our hands around it, the aorta had ruptured and the
patient ended up succumbing to their injuries. But[00:44:00] , , th th
delaying it by a little bit of time affords you the opportunity to
really gather as much information as you can, to make the best decision
on when and how to prepare the aorta.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah. And some of the delays, I mentioned 24 hours,
but I think Wayne is you’re pointing out. It can also be seven days,
right. It can be, you know, as long as no, the thing is that, you know,
you can’t ignore the patient, you got to still stick with anti impulse
therapy.it’s , and you know, very meticulous care cause you can.</p>
<p>You know, there are cases certainly where a delay, you know, can fail,
you know, and those are cases where we lose track of their blood
pressure and, and , , you know, something happens in the, or for a femur
fracture or something, and we lose track and , , we’re not communicating
as a multidisciplinary team and you can turn a stable.</p>
<p>, you know, grade three injury that you’re observing for four, three or
four or five days into one that ruptures that’s were very rare. But
again , , we want to be mindful of, of , , just because we’re delaying
doesn’t mean you get a free pass until the, or, and , , five [00:45:00]
days</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> later. Right? I think if I may, personally, if I’m
going to be watching.</p>
<p>, grade three aortic injury , um, up to seven days that patient’s going
to stay in the ICU with very close monitoring that entire time until the
time of the repair.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> These are fantastic points. And I think we really
covered blunt, thoracic aortic injury , , quite in depth. And I think
our listeners will really enjoy this.</p>
<p>We have two more topics that are much briefer to cover here as we close
out the endovascular management of trauma. Um, so we’re gonna move down
the order a little bit. We’re going to do below the diaphragm, and this
is pretty rare, but there are. Important to keep this in mind. Um, the
blunt abdominal aortic injuries in the endovascular approach to this.</p>
<p>Um, so many times it’s a similar sort of patient population as the , ,
thoracic aortic injuries , , where it’s a multiple injured trauma. And
when we described the blunt abdominal work injury, they in, in repairing
it for endovascular, there’s three zones that are thought of , um, and
the numbers ones, and three are the ones that you can repair , um,
endovascular.</p>
<p>So the zone one is from the diaphragm down to the SMA. Um, zone
[00:46:00] two is the SMA and renal arteries are relatively small
segment, but , , that’s the zone two. And then zone three is from the
inferior renal inferior to the renal arteries, to the aortic
bifurcation. Um, so. Zone one and zone three, you know, above , , from
above the SMA two.</p>
<p>And then also below the renal arteries are the two areas that are
amenable to endovascular repair.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah. Fortunately, Kevin, these things are
extraordinarily uncommon. I mean, most vascular surgeons at level one
trauma centers, I would wager can count on one or two hands, depending
on how old they are. The number of these injuries they’ve had to manage
from an endovascular standpoint.</p>
<p>I think Dr. Rasmussen, what do you think about coverage of the celiac
artery? Um, and what are the factors you think about if you had to
prepare something in that area?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, I think that , um, I think there’s increasing
, um, literature, including I think , , an article and I’m just, won’t
pull the journal here, but I think it’s.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s this November , , JVs about the feasibility and safety of
covering the celiac artery it’s [00:47:00] what’s in this month. JBS is
not pertaining to trauma, but it’s talking about , , covering the celiac
for , , for T VAR EMR, for example, for aneurysm disease. I think we’re
learning that you can cover the celiac safely.</p>
<p>In many cases, I think it, it reminds me of what the left subclavian was
10 years ago. No, no, we were a little nervous. We knew there were some
patients you couldn’t cover it in. And now 10 years later, we pretty
routinely covered that left subclavian. , and I think the celiac artery
is similar. It reminds me of that.</p>
<p>I think in patients, obviously you’ve got to look at the make sure
they’ve got and SMA , , probably an Ima and then internal iliac
arteries, you know, looking at the blood supply to the whole of their
mesentery. And if any of that’s compromised, then that would give me.
Um, you know, pause, certainly if they’ve had a, you know, a gastrectomy
here or some unusual intra-abdominal operation, that’s interrupted their
bowel.</p>
<p>If you will, the gut circulation that would give me pause to cover the
celiac. Um, you know, but otherwise I think if it really gets you out of
a [00:48:00] jam , , which these injuries are like, so yeah, you’re
right. Wayne, they’re pretty rare, but man , they’re, they’re really
hard to. Try to repair open. So that gets a person out of a jam and you
need to cover the celiac.</p>
<p>I think he can.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. I think those are fantastic points. And, you
know, just like with the , , thoracic injuries and other, you know,
situation where you have to be prepared to respond , um, with a bypass,
potentially if, if , um, you know, you have a schema that you didn’t
expect. Um, and so it’s just things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>And one thing I think the we like talked about here is the IVIS is also
very helpful. It’s kind of like a, with. Dissection cases. A lot of
these cases are sort of , um, kind of variants of dissections of, of the
traumatic. And so the IVIS can really help characterize this. You can
help identify these large intimal flaps , um, in pseudo aneurysms or , ,
kind of, and see the branches and help plan your stint graft placement
all with IVIS.</p>
<p>So, So, one thing to keep in mind when, especially if these patients
might not tolerate a lot of contrasts and other kind of situation to
keep in mind, this is an, a patient with significant Tesla. Intestinal
contamination , , the endovascular approach to this [00:49:00] would
help , , eliminate any or. You know, minimize any risk of contamination.</p>
<p>, so Dr. Kazi, as far as the types of graphs , um, that you’re thinking
of when you have a patient , , what are you using? Are you using Tavarez
covered since Eric cuffs? What’s your preferred method?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> My preferred method is to use whatever. Means is going
to cover the least amount of aorta, but still seal the injury.</p>
<p>Um, so the answer to that is, yes, I I’d use all of them. Um, some of
the newer covered balloon expandable and post dilatable stints have
changed our management, particularly in the smaller aorta is at our
level one trauma center. We carry. Basically the entire catalog of
balloon expandable coverage stents.</p>
<p>, one that Kevin recently showed me , um, was we did an iliac branch
case last week and the , , covered stent. I didn’t realize started up.
It started eight millimeters and goes all the way up to 11. I’m sorry.
16 millimeters. Previously, it was a 11 millimeter stent that could be
post dilated up to 16. So in the smaller aorta is , , I think these have
a role , um, and being able to post dilate them.</p>
<p>The [00:50:00] question is how to keep it in place when you’re post
dilating it so that it doesn’t move. And so if that’s a concern, then
oftentimes I will go to a, , , thoracic graft or an aortic cuff or , ,
something that I know is going to deploy and stay stable the entire
time.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> And I think , , now we’re going to move into our final
topic of the day is XLO sub cleaving injuries and endovascular
management.</p>
<p>We chose these three topics is endovascular care has really kind of in
some ways revolutionized , , the management of these. And so , um, as we
know the injuries to the XL, subclavian is very rare. And it’s likely
due to the protective nature of the skeleton, but the fact of the
skeleton there also makes it very difficult to obtain proximal and
distal control.</p>
<p>So , , Dr. Kazi, if you have a patient with some kind of contained some
Flavian injury , um, and you’re going to approach this from an
endovascular approach , , H w what approach do you prefer to, to access
this.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> My preferred approach is from the arm, if at
[00:51:00] all possible , um, that could either be brachial or radio.</p>
<p>Um, depending on the, again, if you have a covered stent that can be
post dilated to a size that can be delivered through a seven French
sheath, and you can use a, a radial access for those patients in that ,
, Can be done percutaneously with low risk. Otherwise I do like to cut
down on the brachial artery, if I’m , um, going to the brachial artery
for trauma just seems to be more reliable for me and sometimes even
quicker.</p>
<p>But, , I, I like the brachial approach, but sometimes I’ll do both the
brachial and the femoral approach , , and combine that with a through
wire. If I have a really tough or challenging aortic arch and I need to
deliver something. Say to the proximal, right. Subclavian. Um, and
you’ve got , , a type three arch or something to that effect.</p>
<p>And I liked the through wire.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Great. And so as far as you know, like discussing our
stint options here, and I I’ve heard , , debates even on Twitter about
this, about whether to use a self-expanding scent, because it might give
you more flexibility, especially if it’s in the axillary artery , um,
versus balloon expandable , um, more precise [00:52:00] deployment,
especially if near kind of branch vessels.</p>
<p>Um, Dr. SBS. And do you have a, do you have a preferred stint or do you
just base it on the situation?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> I think that we , um, had , , you know, I think
initially we aired. Um, and well, I don’t know, we erred on the side of
self-expanding initially, if you think back , um, you know, when we
first started treating this injury pattern with endo techniques covered
stents, all of the covered stents available were self-expanding.</p>
<p>We didn’t really have , um, you know, 10, 15 years ago, we didn’t have
viable , um, Balloon expandable covered stents. And so I think, you
know, therefore that’s what we got used to, whether it was the via Bon
or the old fluency or whatever the self-expanding. And so we got used to
that and I think more recently in the last three to four, five years , ,
there’s now , um, really nice balloon expandable covered stents, which
are flexible, I think it’s dealer’s choice in a lot of ways. I do think
there is truth to , um, balloon expandable for more precise landing. You
know, I just think that [00:53:00] premise of stenting is holds true,
meaning that if you gotta really nail something , , you know, close to a
Lima an internal mammary , um, for you read in relation to the
vertebral.</p>
<p>Um, you know, blue expandable is I think more accurate if it’s , , more
distally and needed in a longer stand in the axilla than using a
self-expanding is just fine. Another thing that, you know, I think you
may get to, but sometimes there’s you need to come from both right.</p>
<p>The arm, retro grade. Um, but if he can’t retrograde, you know,
sometimes coming antegrade , um, for imaging and sometimes to , to, to
really make that connection between the disruption but coming from the
groin into the. Origin of the subclavian axillary , , antegrade is, is
needed as well.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> one of my techniques for that was to have a through
wire. So I had snare wire and the descending thoracic aorta. especially
for challenging arch. Then I would come across with a sheath from the
femoral artery and then deploy my stint with a through wire. Um, and
that I felt, gives me a pretty [00:54:00] precise deployment , ,
particularly if I’m really trying to nail something.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure that there’s no curves or bends and that the
stent delivery. Which is usually a little stiffer than the sheath is
going to be able to make it around and be very precise. Particularly if
you’re trying, like you said, nail on a vertebral artery or , um, and
Ima</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> yeah, we had one where we, our last one we did here,
a couple of my partners are pretty crafty and skilled and, and we, we
actually had to put us , , we had to, I think we used a snare, right.</p>
<p>from the arm. We couldn’t get , , the wire to make the approach. So we
put a aim up, you know, antegrade through the lifts of Clayton, got a
snare sort of out there, and we’re able to snare the free wire and bring
it through. That’s pretty rare, pretty uncommon. Um, but you know , , I
think those are all techniques that we’re learning , , for the, kind of
the fringes of these injury patterns, which used to be too severe for us
to treat with endo.</p>
<p>And now we’re actually finding with technology and experience that
actually you can, you can treat the vast majority of these. [00:55:00]</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. These are , , A lot, a lot of options and things
are going to continue to evolve as our technology improves. It’s kind of
a theme of this episode. ,</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> I seem to find that when people have these injuries
there, for some reason that maybe this is just my own experience, it
seems to be that they’re more contra-indicated for anticoagulation.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s because the , , nature of the injury to injure
something in the, you know, in the. Bony thorax, such as scapulothoracic
dissociation or a sub claiming artist, pseudo aneurysm. I remember I can
remember there’s cases where the central line goes in for a head injured
patient because they need to monitor their CVPs.</p>
<p>Um, I prefer to have a brachial open approach to that. And when I can’t
give anticoagulation, just because I can, then I’m set up to do an
embolectomy if need be for the brachial artery.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, I think that, I think that’s a great point. And
just wrap this up, and as far as discussing, you know, options you have
from the endovascular approach, there really it’s up to your
imagination.</p>
<p>, , you know , , whether it’s [00:56:00] approximate rights of Cleveland
injury, approximal, left, subclavian and injury. Um, you know, you can
use a hybrid approach. I I’ve seen multiple examples of , , large
hematomas where , , proximal, distal control are obtained , , whether
it’s over a three wire from the arm.</p>
<p>Um, and then you can approach it open. Um, it really helps in that
situation. Um, I know , , recently we had a case where we did some
parallel stinting of the brachiocephalic in order to, to treat injury.,
and, and you can even use , , the approach to embolize. You can embolize
the subclavian arteries , um, and you know, and do things , , with.</p>
<p>As long as you’re respecting the people already. So , , keep in mind,
you know, there’s not one kind of recipe for treating these exits of
Cleveland injuries , um, and really kind of adjusting it to the patient.
you know, kind of the last thing I’ll mention is , , sometimes these
patients, you know, would probably do better with a bypass, especially
with some axillary artery injuries.</p>
<p>You know, it’s going to be in a pretty mobile spot , , but they’re too
sick. And so , , I’ve seen it even done where they use a stint graph to
temporize things, to keep inline flow. And then at a more stable time,
maybe a week, a month later, take them back and perform the bypass</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> [00:57:00] before you end. I don’t want to get you ,
, let you off the hook.</p>
<p>I think the question for you guys and your listeners and , and, and this
may be the most important question of our discussion is to what degree
does it, should we in the military? Try to take these endo technologies
into our deployed hospitals. Um, we’ve just discussed a range of
injuries in which patients do better.</p>
<p>Right? So they bleed less. They’re often less , , less frequently
paralyzed from T-bar for example , , they survive more, they , , with
these endo technologies. So are we telling ourselves that that’s okay
for civilians off the street in the U S. , but not good enough. , but,
but our, what our service members have to just kind of get by and the
deployed range.</p>
<p>Do you know when they’re down range with these injuries or is it our
responsibility to develop systems of casualty care in which we can take
these technologies down range? What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s a great point. I mean , um,
Obviously the farther [00:58:00] out you get. So like when I was in a
Ford surgical team in Afghanistan, we, it took us three months to get ,
um, the most primitive x-ray machine you could think of.</p>
<p>And just to get a chest x-ray to see if there was a pneumothorax. But
when you get back to the rural three , um, level, which for everyone,
for the listeners, that’s a combat support hospital. So there were, for
instance, there would be one in Baghdad. So there’s one that triages to
the next level of care from all the forward surgical teams to a combat
support hospital.</p>
<p>There’s, there’s two in Afghanistan, for instance, but , um, They don’t
are always equipped with endovascular technologies as Dr. Rasmussen’s
really alluding to. And as a matter of fact, there, there are going to
be no thoracic endo to repair there’s. Um, the capabilities is digital
subtraction angiography. Um, usually it best to say, you know, treat a
bypass.</p>
<p>Yeah. But I do think that one of the things we brought up in this
podcast and Dr. Brass means I’d be interested in your, your thoughts is
that we have demonstrated that there is a delayed [00:59:00] timing of
repair for a Arctic injuries. And I do think that deployment and placing
an, a thoracic endograft or a covered stent.</p>
<p>In say Germany, Walter Reed or San Antonio is much better than trying to
do the same thing in Baghdad or bog room or Kandahar Afghanistan,
because , um, there are the, a septic techniques are not going to be the
same there as they are here. And the bacteria and the microorganisms
that exist in those environments are also significantly different than
what we experienced in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s a great question. And, you know,
I kinda, I get a little bit fired up about it. Um, I know you’ve got a
lot of young, you know , you’ve, you’ve guys got the future , , who are
your listeners? You know, and I think there there’s a ton of , um, brain
power, you know, intellectual capacity that listens to this , , and it’s
to your guys’s credit.</p>
<p>I think it’s, it’s going to be up to, to the next generation, right. To
figure out. How do we integrate , , endo [01:00:00] technologies for
wartime scenarios and , um, you know, and I think to it’s , it’s, it’s
like it’s too big of a topic to answer that with one question. But I
think if you take it in , in, in, in sort of intervals and you say ,
well, in the near term, right?</p>
<p>So from now to 2022, 2023, Maybe all we can do is get like what you
said, Wayne. Let’s make sure we have vascular go teams on the West coast
and the East coast. , who can go into the Pacific or the European
theater, African theater , , with endo stuff. Right? So that if, if we
can’t get a casually back, we can , um, you know, figure out what we can
do in the near term.</p>
<p>But, you know, in the, in the, in the midterm, whose fault is it that
there’s no digital subtraction NGO to rule three? Is that, do we just
going to blame it on the system and say, it’s a damn shame. Where is
that our fault? Right. Cause we’re not articulating this. And I think,
you know , we, we should think about that.</p>
<p>I think that, yes. , so you know, most of the time a covered stent for
sure. Yeah, absolutely. Wayne. I mean, you’d definitely rather have a
T-bar and, you know, Germany or , , [01:01:00] Walter Reed or bamse
than, than in Ballade or Bodrum, Afghanistan, for example. But some
patients can’t wait. Right. And so. You know, how do we establish an
endo specific trauma inventory and get it into the cash?</p>
<p>Right? So the, for the select cases who can’t wait, what if it’s a type
three or type four , , blunt, aortic injury, do we then commit that
service member to, you know, an antiquated treatment, maybe , , if it’s
a one cause, and it’s particularly relevant in this discussion, because
you’ve mentioned injury patterns that can be highly lethal, but are
particularly amenable.</p>
<p>To end of therapies, you know, and there’s no answer to it. And I don’t
mean to get too fired up, but I, I’m excited to sort of pose that
question to the young and innovative, you know, listeners that you guys
have to help us think about. What does a trauma specific endo inventory,
how can it be brought to, you know, resource limited circumstances or
scenarios to, to provide the benefit that these technologies have to
some of these patients.</p>
<p>It’s great discussion. And [01:02:00] I really appreciate the
opportunity to spend some time with, , , with you guys. , and, and , ,
it’s been fun.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Absolutely. And doctor asked me to sing. You have to
thank you for this entire series for joining us and taking time out of
your very busy schedule to get down and dirty and talk very specific and
very technical.</p>
<p>Um, I think this will be a resource for years to come for both the
listeners of behind the knife and audible bleeding. So thank you. Thank
you again, and thank you, Dr. Kazi for joining us and helping us with
this discussion. Yeah. Thanks</p>
