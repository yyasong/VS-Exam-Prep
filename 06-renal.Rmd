## Pathophysiology

**What is renovascular hypertension?**

Hypertension as a result of progressive renal artery stenosis

-   While renal artery stenosis is a relatively common finding in older
    patients with hypertension, it's relatively uncommon as the primary
    cause of hypertension.

**What is ischemic nephropathy?**

Decreased renal function and/or chronic kidney disease that results from
atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis due to a reduction in glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) and rise in creatine produced by any cause of
diminished renal blood flow. Primary mechanism is chronic hypoperfusion.
[@rickey125RenovascularDisease2019]

**Who is at risk for ischemic nephropathy?**

Renal injury can develop in anyone with a kidney or kidney region beyond
a critically stenotic artery

Now, this is usually in patients with atherosclerotic disease, but any
flow limiting lesion---such as coarctation of the aorta, mid-aortic
syndrome, or fibromuscular dyplasia-- can cause ischemic neuropathy OR
renovascular hypertension.

In terms of clinical practice, the prevalence of renovascular
hypertension is probably less than 1 % in patients with mild
hypertension but may be as high as 10 to 40 % in patients with acute
(even if superimposed on a preexisting elevation in blood pressure),
severe, or refractory hypertension.

**That's the best you can do, 10-40%? That's a big window.**

Yes, and it illustrates the biggest issue we have with renovascular
disease. We know 5-22 % of patients 50 years or older who have advanced
CKD have some degree of renal artery stenosis and 23 to 54% of these
patients have bilateral renal artery disease.

-   Bilateral renal arterial stenosis is associated with more widespread
    atherosclerotic disease, higher serum creatinine levels, and higher
    mortality than unilateral disease

-   Renal artery revascularization among patients in these studies
    infrequently produced a meaningful recovery of kidney function,
    which would have supported the diagnosis

**So not everyone with flow limitations to their renal vascular will get
renovascular hypertension or ischemic nephropathy?**

Not at all, actually. Flow limiting lesions may be an "incidental"
finding in patients who have CKD or hypertension that is caused by a
separate disorder (eg, diabetic nephropathy and essential/primary
hypertension).

-   Because of this, it can be very difficult to distinguish between
    patient whose disease is induced by renal artery stenosis and those
    who have alternative causes of CKD or renovascular hypertension.

**So you're telling me that we have no idea who has clinically
significant disease and who doesn't?**

No. Fortunately there are clinical findings that suggest that
renovascular disease is an underlying cause:

-   Recent or rapid development of severe hypertension.

    -   Relatively specific for renovascular hypertension and is the
        strongest predictor of antihypertensive benefit from
        revascularization.

-   Severe hypertension that may be treatment resistant.

    -   Some patients with ischemic nephropathy are normotensive, which
        may be due in part to a reduced cardiac output

-   Acute rise in serum creatinine following the administration of
    angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin
    receptor blockers (ARBs).

    -   Rise in serum creatinine is more common with agents that block
        the renin-angiotensin system than with other antihypertensive
        drugs because glomerular filtration rate (GFR) often depends
        upon the efferent arteriolar actions of angiotensin II in this
        setting.

    -   More common with bilateral as compared with unilateral disease
        because there is hemodynamic compromise to the entire renal
        functional mass

    -   This usually resolves after withdrawal of the drug.

    -   Restoring the renal blood supply in such cases can recover the
        ability to use these drugs for blood pressure control.

-   Significant variability of serum creatinine concentration that may
    be due to changes in volume status

-   A rapid rise in arterial pressure associated with sudden development
    of left ventricular failure ("flash pulmonary edema").

    -   This finding is more common with renal artery stenosis because
        bilateral disease is also associated with diuretic resistance
        and sympathetic adrenergic activation

-   Deterioration of kidney function after placement of an endovascular
    aortic stent graft-- IATROGENIC

    -   EVAR with isolated L renal coverage -\> splenal renal bypass,
        ligate splenic artery distally and then perform end-to-end
        anastomosis to renal artery.
        [@benjamin126RenovascularDisease2019]

**So it matters which kidney is affected or if it's one or both?**

Yes, effect of the stenosis may not be clinically apparent due to
compensatory function of the unaffected contralateral kidney

Most cases of renal artery stenosis affect one side much more than the
other; one kidney is affected with the second kidney being essentially
normal, hence the designation "unilateral" disease.

-   In patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis, contralateral
    kidney is damaged by uncontrolled hypertension and circulating
    angiotensin II and aldosterone. [@rickey125RenovascularDisease2019]

Patients who are diagnosed with ischemic nephropathy usually have
high-grade stenosis of both renal arteries or stenosis to a solitary
functioning kidney.

-   It is this subpopulation of the disease that merits specific
    consideration because of its additional contribution to fluid
    retention, loss of kidney function, and congestive heart failure.

**What are the pathophysiological mechanisms at play here?**

Like we said, first you need a flow limitation. We mentioned several,
but by in large There are two major causes of renal artery stenosis:

1.  Atherosclerosis -- you'll generally see this in patients over 45
    years old, likely with known PVD/CAD---though it can occur as an
    isolated renal lesion---usually involving the aortic orifice or the
    proximal main renal artery.

2.  Fibromuscular dysplasia -- These patients are most often women under
    the age of 50 years and typically involves the mid- or distal main
    renal artery or the intrarenal branches.

    -   Rarely iatrogenic from malposition or migration of endovascular
        aortic stent grafts over the renal orifices.

3.  Takayasu's arteritis - although a rare cause of renovascular
    hypertension, this is the most common presentation of Takayasu's
    arteritis (60%). First line therapy is open revascularization.

```

<!--# Needs a reference -->

**I think the flow limitation part has been well established. What
next?**

Renal (especially bilateral) hypoperfusion induces activation of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which increases vascular tone and
impairs sodium excretion resulting in expansion of the extracellular
fluid volume.

## Medical Management and Evaluation

**Can't we just treat their hypertension and give these patients an ACE
inhibitor at this point?**

Sure. And oftentimes we do. In fact, many of these patients can be
treated with medical therapy without loss of function or irreversible
fibrosis, sometimes for many years

-   Studies in human subjects demonstrate that, despite a moderate
    reduction in renal perfusion pressure (up to 40 %) and in renal
    blood flow (mean 30 %), glomerular filtration is reduced but tissue
    oxygenation within the kidney cortex and medulla can adapt without
    the development of severe hypoxia.

-   But this only works to an extent.

**Explain that...**

As the hypertension is treated, we're lowering the pressure gradient
across the stenosis and can actually increase the degree of renal
malperfusion and worsen the renal function.

-   Oftentimes this loss of kidney function is a reversible consequence
    of antihypertensive therapy but it to some degree limits our ability
    to control the hypertension medically without causing further damage
    to the kidneys.... And it can also reflect progressive narrowing of
    the renal arteries and/or progressive intrinsic kidney disease as
    more advanced vascular occlusion, corresponding to a 70 to 80%
    narrowing of the renal artery, leads to demonstrable cortical
    hypoxia.

**Can we tell who has cortical hypoxia through diagnostic tests?**

A: To some degree. Cortical perfusion can be measured by blood oxygen
level dependent magnetic resonance (BOLD-MR). Additionally, inflammatory
markers sampled from renal veins of stenotic kidneys correlated strongly
with the degree of hypoxia (as measured by BOLD-MR), particularly after
correction of the stenosis with angioplasty

**So we have a patient with evidence of malperfused kidneys, either
through worsening renal function or uncontrolled hypertension, with
known discrete stenoses, and we even got a BOLD-MRI which confirms it.
Let's just revascularize them and be done with it?**

Not so fast. Although vascular stenosis or occlusion can initiate these
processes, long-standing ischemia causes parenchymal injury
characterized by inflammation and fibrosis which eventually becomes an
irreversible process. At some point, restoring renal blood flow provides
no recovery of kidney function or clinical benefit.

**So how can we determine who has CKD or hypertension due to
renovascular stenosis that we can actually help?**

This is probably the most important question since in this whole disease
process.

-   To start, if a patient has the clinical manifestations of ischemic
    nephropathy or renovascular hypertension as we discussed above, a
    presumptive diagnosis of ischemic nephropathy can be made if there
    is radiologic documentation of significant stenosis (usually more
    than 70 % luminal occlusion) of both renal arteries or of one renal
    artery to a solitary functioning kidney.

**But how do we know the vascular occlusive disease posing critical
hemodynamic limitation to kidney function?**

-   Generally, luminal occlusion of at least 60 to 75 % is required to
    limit blood flow and reduce perfusion pressure

-   This degree of stenosis is usually associated with a measurable
    translesional "pull-back" pressure gradient of 10 to 15 mmHg.

-   Doppler ultrasound criteria [@hoffmannRoleDuplexScanning1991;
    @zierlerStrandnessDuplexScanning2016]

    -   Peak systolic velocities above \>170 cm/sec with post stenotic
        turbulence to identify less than 60 % luminal stenosis.

    -   Renal aortic ratio \>3.5 required to diagnose greater than 60%
        stenosis.

    -   Elevated velocities can be seen with tortuosity, but this should
        be able to be confirmed with B-mode.

-   Identifiable levels of cortical hypoxia (measured by blood oxygen
    level dependent magnetic resonance BOLD-MR) are usually associated
    with translesional velocities above 385 cm/sec or reduction of
    single kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the range of 20 to
    25 mL/min.

-   MRA can be used for evaluation

    -   Pro - no radiation, good imaging of distal renal arteries, no
        degradation from ostial calcium.

    -   Cons - requires GAD -\> interstitial fibrosis in CKD
        $$@galanNephrogenicSystemicFibrosis$$ and degrades with motion
        and respiration
        [@nelsonGadoliniumenhancedBreathholdThreedimensional1999]

**Most importantly: is the condition of the kidneys such that restoring
renal blood flow is likely to benefit function?**

Short answer, we still can't be certain.

Long answer, we can at least have some idea by considering the renal
resistive index, the six-month trajectory of kidney function, and the
size of the kidneys or by performing a kidney biopsy (which is not
usually done).

-   None of these factors predict the outcome of revascularization with
    certainty.

-   [Improved and validated methods to evaluate the salvageability of
    kidney function in this disorder are greatly needed and are the holy
    grail of this disease process.]{.underline}

**Let's go through some of these:**

[Renal Resistive index:]{.underline}

Some studies indicate that elevated resistive indices in segmental
vessels (above 0.80) measured by duplex ultrasound denote poor prognosis
for renal recovery while a low resistive index is a favorable sign.

[Trajectory of kidney function]{.underline}

The most consistent predictor of good recovery of kidney function after
revascularization has been a recent deterioration of kidney function
(ie, in the prior six to twelve months).

[Kidney size]{.underline}

Very small kidneys (less than 7 cm in longest diameter) are usually
considered unlikely to recover after revascularization.

[Kidney biopsy]{.underline}

Previous studies suggest that biopsy demonstrating preexisting
atheroembolic changes and interstitial fibrosis indicate a limited
potential for recovery.

-   Biopsies are not usually performed.

[Comparison of kidney morphology with kidney function]{.underline}

Some investigators have recommended assessing morphologic parameters,
such as renal parenchymal volume and cortical thickness with MRI, and
comparing these parameters with kidney function measured by radionuclide
scanning

-   In a stenotic kidney, apparently normal morphology combined with
    reduced function may indicate a "hibernating kidney" that could be
    salvaged with revascularization.

**So how do we get a definitive diagnosis?**

A definitive diagnosis is not usually made before revascularization. In
practice, confirmation of the diagnosis is based upon stabilization or
improvement of the GFR after successful revascularization.

## Operative Managment

**Now we think our patient's renal artery stenosis maybe is causing
hypertension or decline in renal function and we can possibly reverse
it... how do we treat it?**

For starters, all of these patients should receive medical therapy to
control their hypertension in addition to routine CKD care and
surveillance. They need to be aggressively treated for secondary
prevention of cardiovascular morbidity with aspirin, statins, cessation
of smoking, and, in patients with diabetes, glycemic control.

**Second, once diagnosis has been made we have 2 therapeutic
alternatives... Which are?**

First, medical therapy alone- this generally involves ACE-I or ARB and
as we discussed.

RAS can worsen ACE-I and ARB induced renal dysfunction due to systemic
hypotension, efferent arterial vasodilation, and reduced glomerular
hydrostatic pressure, in turn lowering GFR.
[[@rickey125RenovascularDisease2019;
@schoolwerthRenalConsiderationsAngiotensin2001]]

**Okay, in other words we can have chronic normalization of the systemic
pressure that might eventually lead to ischemic atrophy due to the
reduced renal perfusion pressure distal to the stenosis? Any other
concerns with medical management alone?**

-   We're addressing or prevention progression of stenosis in those with
    atherosclerotic disease.

**Since this isn't a vascular medicine podcast, what's our other
option?**

Procedural intervention (open or endovascular) along with medical
therapy.

**Now you're talking. Who should we fix operatively?**

Some but not all patients should undergo revascularization, Patient
selection single most important factor.

Depends upon the hemodynamic severity and likely recoverability of
kidney function

**You mentioned recoverability before, can you once again touch on some
recoverability indicators?**

-   A short duration of blood pressure elevation prior to the diagnosis
    of renovascular disease, since this is the strongest clinical
    predictor of a fall in blood pressure after renal revascularization

-   Failure of optimal medical therapy to control the blood pressure

-   Intolerance to optimal medical therapy (eg, deterioration of renal
    function during antihypertensive drug therapy)

-   Recurrent flash pulmonary edema and/or refractory heart failure

-   Otherwise unexplained progressive renal insufficiency, particularly
    if proteinuria is absent

-   CKD stage 3a and 3b most likely to benefit from revascularization.
    [@singerImpactBaselineRenal2009]

    -   Lower GFR likely to progress to ESRD

-   Degree of stenosis, age, pre-procedure BP control and meds are not
    assocaited with improvement.
    [@textorPercutaneousRevascularizationIschemic2013]

**But do we have any good data proving our interventions help?**

This is where things can get muddy.

Early on, observational studies demonstrated a high rate of procedural
success with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) and
stent placement (\~85%) in patients with ostial atherosclerotic disease,
as well as a high rate of clinical success measured by improvements in
blood pressure and kidney function in 50 to 75 % of subjects.

**Anything better than observational studies?**

Unfortunately, randomized trials showed no additional benefit from
stenting when added to medical therapy with respect to blood pressure
control, renal function, cardiovascular events, and mortality. But these
studies have their own limitations.

**The one we keep hearing about is the CORAL trial. Tell me about
that.**

-   CORAL trial [@cooperStentingMedicalTherapy2014]

    -   Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL)
        trial

    -   947 patients (80 % had unilateral disease) who met the following
        two criteria:

        -   Unilateral or bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery
            stenosis \>60 % if diagnosed with conventional angiography,
            peak systolic velocity \>300 cm/second if diagnosed by
            duplex Doppler ultrasonography, Luminal narrowing \>80 % if
            diagnosed with magnetic resonance angiography or
            computerized tomography angiography (or \>70 % with
            additional evidence of renal ischemia)

        -   Systolic hypertension despite two or more antihypertensive
            medications and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate
            (eGFR) \<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 that was presumably due to the
            stenosis.

        -   All patients received antiplatelet therapy plus best medical
            therapy including ARB

    -   Revascularization had no additional effect on the primary
        outcome (a composite of cardiovascular or renal death, stroke,
        myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, a
        reduction in eGFR by more than 30 %, or end-stage renal disease)
        as compared with medical therapy alone (35.1 versus 35.8 %).

    -   No effect on any of the individual components of the primary
        outcome.

    -   Low procedural complication rate \~2%

    -   Similar findings in the ASTRAL trial
        [@astralinvestigatorsRevascularizationMedicalTherapy2009]

**Well, that sounds pretty convincing.**

-   Limitations on existing treatment data:

    -   [Considerable selection bias]{.underline} -- For the most part,
        the patients enrolled in these trials did **not** meet the
        criteria for selecting patients likely to benefit from
        intervention (eg, short duration of blood pressure elevation,
        hypertension resistant to medical therapy, recurrent flash
        pulmonary edema):

        -   CORAL [@cooperStentingMedicalTherapy2014]

            -   Patients hospitalized for heart failure within 30 days
                of screening for the trial were excluded, thereby
                limiting the number of trial participants with recurrent
                flash pulmonary edema.

            -   Mean number of antihypertensive medications used by
                CORAL participants at baseline was 2.1- many had not
                failed optimal medical therapy

            -   More than 25 % had controlled blood pressure upon entry
                into the trial.

            -   Mortality and event rates lower than in most previous
                registries, suggesting that many high-risk patients were
                not enrolled.

        -   ASTRAL
            [@astralinvestigatorsRevascularizationMedicalTherapy2009]

            -   Large number of patients had stenoses that were probably
                not clinically significant (50 to 70 %), and patients
                were excluded if their primary doctors felt that they
                "definitely" needed revascularization.

    -   [Results of the trials differ substantially from observational
        reports of "high-risk" subsets]{.underline}

        -   For the most part, patients selected by their treating
            clinicians to undergo revascularization have derived greater
            benefit from revascularization than did patients enrolled in
            the trials who were randomly assigned to revascularization

### Endovascular Therapy

**We've determined our patient is an appropriate candidate for
intervention, and we don't fully buy into CORAL, what can we do?**

-   [Percutaneous renal angioplasty/stenting]{.underline}in addition to
    medical therapy

    -   Most commonly employed if technically feasible.

    -   Most amenable lesions to angioplasty are those producing
        incomplete occlusion in the main renal artery.

        -   Total occlusions and ostial lesions extending into aorta
            generally do not respond well to angioplasty alone due to
            elastic recoil.

    -   Quick results: maximum antihypertensive response is generally
        observed at 48 hours after the procedure

        -   But BP levels and antihypertensive drug requirements often
            change over subsequent weeks

    -   In general, the effects of revascularization on blood pressure
        were greater in bilateral disease, but effects on renal function
        and mortality did not differ in those with bilateral as compared
        with unilateral stenosis .

    -   Most atherosclerotic lesions are now treated with primary
        stenting to avoid rapid development of restenosis.

        -   A higher initial primary success rate, defined as less than
            50 % stenosis (88 versus 57 %).

        -   At six months, a higher patency rate (75 versus 29 %) and a
            lower restenosis rate (14 versus 48 %).

        -   Twelve patients assigned to PTRA alone underwent stenting
            because of treatment failure within six months. These
            patients had a similar blood pressure response as those
            initially treated with stenting.

    -   Performing a renal angiogram
        [@edwards127RenovascularDisease2019]

        1.  Supine with arms overhead or straight out to the sides

        2.  LAO 15-20deg

        3.  Flush catheter placed just above the renals

        4.  Breath hold, high frame rate and non-DSA due unavoidable
            patient movement

**What about complications?**

-   Complication rate with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty
    with or without stenting is between 5 and 15 %

    -   Mostly minor: puncture site hematoma and renal artery
        dissection.

    -   Serious complications more rare: renal artery thrombosis or
        perforation, AKI 2/2 atheroembolic disease (\~1%)or
        radiocontrast agent injury.

    -   Mortality exceedingly rare

**Outcomes data**

-   In the correct patient population:

    -   Unilateral disease

        -   PTRA alone results in normalization of blood pressure
            (removal of antihypertensive drug therapy) \~8-20%

        -   Some improvement 50-60%

        -   Failure rate \~20-30%

        -   Restenosis rate of 8 to 30 % at two years (without stent)

        -   Better results with unilateral fibromuscular disease.

        -   Less consistent for patients with chronic hypertension
            compared with patients who have an acute elevation in blood
            pressure

    -   Bilateral disease

        -   25-30% will recover kidney function to a meaningful degree,
            sometimes avoiding progression to end-stage kidney disease
            (ESKD) and/or the need for renal replacement therapy.

        -   \~50% will have little immediate change in kidney function
            but will "stabilize"

        -   \~20% will have a progressive deterioration of kidney
            function, sometimes related to the procedure

**Guidelines**

-   2005 ACC/AHA guidelines on peripheral artery disease recommends that
    a stent be placed in patients undergoing PTRA for treatment of
    atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [@hirschACCAHA20052006]

    -   PTRA without stent placement is rarely performed unless the
        anatomy precludes stenting.

    -   POBA without stenting is generally less successful and
        associated with more complications (eg atheroemboli)

**How durable is PTA/stenting?**

-   Restenosis

    -   \~11-17%

        -   11-39% during the first one to two years

    -   Detected as a rise in blood pressure requiring more intensive
        therapy

    -   Angioplasty/stenting injures the vascular endothelium, which may
        result in restenosis.

    -   Symptomatic stenosis leading to a rise in blood pressure or a
        fall in GFR are less common and are reported in 10 to 20 % of
        patients

**How do you follow these patients after stenting?**

-   Follow-up of patients who have had a renal artery stent should
    include serial measurements of blood pressure and estimation of GFR.

    -   Post-stent duplex ultrasound \@2-4weeks with

    -   Repeated examinations on a quarterly basis (not much data)

    -   Patients who develop an increase in pressure or reduced GFR
        after stenting should undergo duplex ultrasonography to identify
        restenosis

    -   Retreatment with angioplasty with or without repeat stenting can
        be attempted, but the restenosis rate after repeat angioplasty
        is increased.

        -   Surgical reconstruction may be pursued in patients with
            recurrent episodes of restenosis and loss of kidney
            function.

### Open Surgery

**What about an open operation?**

-   [Surgical revascularization]{.underline} used in addition to medical
    therapy

    -   Less common since the widespread application of effective
        antihypertensive drug therapy and endovascular stents (mid 90s)

**So who still gets open repair?** [@benjamin126RenovascularDisease2019]

-   Younger patients
-   Unfavorable anatomy (i.e. occlusion or branch disease)
-   Failures of endovascular therapy (i.e. in stent restenosis)
-   Need for concomittent aortic revascularization.

**How do we do it?**

-   Involves bypassing the stenotic segment or of removing a small
    atrophic kidney with nearly complete arterial occlusion.

    -   From the aorta or hepatorenal or splenorenal bypass to avoid
        diseased aorta.

    -   Bilateral: either bilateral repair or unilateral repair with
        contralateral nephrectomy of a nonfunctioning, atrophic kidney.

-   Bilateral ostial disease in a young patient can be treated with
    transverse arteriotomy and bilateral renal endarterectomy. Close
    primarily or with PTFE/polyester patch. Second line is bilateral
    bypass with GVS. [@benjamin126RenovascularDisease2019]

**How do outcomes compare to PTA/stenting?**

-   Equally or more effective than PTRA in the treatment of
    atherosclerotic disease, with cure of or improvement in the
    hypertension occurring in 80 to 95 % of patients.

    -   Cure of hypertension after surgery is most likely in patients
        who have been hypertensive for less than five years

-   Lack of complete response was usually associated with one of two
    factors:

    -   Presence of underlying primary/essential hypertension

    -   Development of intrarenal vascular disease due to exposure of
        the contralateral kidney to the elevated blood pressure.

**Guidelines recommendations?**

-   2005 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
    (ACC/AHA) guidelines [@hirschACCAHA20052006]

    -   Open surgery in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery
        stenosis largely restricted to those who have multiple small
        renal arteries, have early primary branching of the main renal
        artery, require aortic reconstruction near the renal arteries
        for other indications (eg, aneurysm repair or severe aortoiliac
        occlusive disease), or to avoid manipulation of a highly
        diseased aorta or failed endovascular stents (using specific
        surgical techniques, including splenorenal, ileorenal, or
        hepatorenal bypass procedures).

**So why not do it instead of stent?**

-   In-hospital mortality: \~3-10 % in high volume centers

    -   Risk factors diffuse atherosclerosis, advanced age, chronic
        kidney disease, heart failure, or chronic lung disease.

    -   No deaths in 105 procedures for fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).

## Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD)

**You mentioned FMD as a cause of renovascular hypertension, tell me
more about that...**

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic
disorder that leads to arterial stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm,
dissection, and arterial tortuosity.

-   Virtually always diagnosed radiographically -- formerly
    pathologically, but rarely sent for specimen in modern diagnosis or
    treatment

**How do we classify it?**

-   Most commonly classified by angiographic appearance:

    -   Multifocal FMD (more common)

        -   angiographic appearance of a "string of beads."

        -   corresponds pathologically to medial fibroplasia, the most
            common histologic type, and to perimedial fibroplasia, which
            is less common.

    -   Focal FMD (less common)

        -   angiographic appearance of a "circumferential or tubular
            stenosis"

        -   corresponds pathologically to intimal fibroplasia but medial
            hyperplasia and periarterial hyperplasia may also have a
            focal appearance.

    -   These two different angiographic subtypes of FMD (multifocal and
        focal) have different phenotypic presentations and natural
        history

        -   Is FMD is, in fact, a single disease?

**Where does it occur?**

-   Has been observed in nearly every arterial bed

-   Involvement of the renal arteries \~75-80%

-   Involvement of the extracranial cerebrovascular arteries (eg,
    carotid and vertebral arteries) \~75%

    -   2/3 of patients have multiple arteries involved.

**Who has FMD?**

-   \~90% of cases in adults are in women.

    -   No female predominance among children with FMD.

-   Mean age at diagnosis was 52 years, with a range of 5 to 86 years

    -   In the past, it was believed that FMD was a disease of young
        women. However, older now know to make up a large proportion of
        affected

-   35-50% of cases in children and 5-10% of cases in adults under the
    age of 60 years with renovascular hypertension

-   Often an incidental finding:

    -   4.4% of potential kidney donors had evidence of FMD.

    -   CORAL trial:

        -   FMD was discovered in 5.7% of the total study population
            (8.8% of enrolled females)

**What causes FMD?**

The exact etiology of FMD remains unknown, but some mechanisms have been
proposed

-   Most often results from medial fibroplasia (60-90% of cases).
    Collagen deposits in the media result in elastic fibrils and
    fibromuscular ridges. [@olinFibromuscularDysplasiaState2014]

-   'Genetics may play an important role in development

    -   Some studies report autosomal mode of inheritance with variable
        penetrance

    -   Potential association with a single nucleotide variant in the
        phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1)

    -   Variant rs9349379 is also a risk locus for coronary artery
        disease, migraine headache, and cervical artery dissection.

-   Predominance of young/childbearing age women hormonal influences are
    thought to play a role

    -   Remains unproven.

-   Mechanical factors such as stretch and trauma unproven.

**Does FMD present differently that the atherosclerotic renovascular
disease we talked about?**

-   Varies widely depending on artery affected and as it results from:

-   Ischemia related to stenosis

-   Dissection and occlusion of major arteries (renal infarction,
    stroke, myocardial infarction)

-   Rupture of aneurysms

-   Embolization of intravascular thrombi from dissection or aneurysms

**What are the common presenting symptoms and signs**

-   Manifestations of renal FMD (eg, hypertension, flank pain) are more
    likely to occur in men, as are arterial dissections and aneurysms.

    -   Most common presenting signs:

    -   Hypertension -- 67% (66% of women and 74 % of men)

-   But overall hypertension is the most common manifestation of renal
    artery FMD in both genders

    -   Flank pain and abdominal pain can result from ischemia, aneurysm
        rupture, or dissection of renal and mesenteric arteries,
        respectively.

**Are these dissections common?**

-   High prevalence of aneurysm and/or dissection

    -   Aneurysm (22%) and dissection (26%).

        -   34% of aneurysms were renal

        -   11% of dissections were renal

    -   42% had an aneurysm and/or dissection.

**So should we screen for these dissections in a patient with known
FMD?**

-   Every patient diagnosed with FMD should have one-time,
    head-to-pelvic CTA (or MRA) is an alternative.

    -   CTA of the neck and head on one day followed one week later by
        CTA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis

**When should we suspect FMD?**

-   Hypertension (particularly in a woman under the age of 60 years)
    with findings that would prompt an evaluation for secondary
    hypertension:

    -   Severe or resistant hypertension.

    -   Onset of hypertension before the age of 35 years.

    -   A sudden rise in blood pressure over a previously stable
        baseline.

    -   A significant increase in the serum creatinine concentration
        after the institution of therapy with an angiotensin-converting
        enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in
        the absence of an excessive reduction in blood pressure.

    -   An epigastric/abdominal bruit.

-   Renal artery dissection (or carotid, vertebral, coronary)

-   Aneurysm in a visceral, carotid, vertebral, or intracranial vessel.

-   Renal infarction.

**How do we diagnose this and/or distinguish it from renovascular
atherosclerotic disease?**

-   Confirmed by diagnostic imaging that reveals consistent findings

-   Noninvasive imaging test is usually performed first. This includes
    CTA, MRA, and Duplex ultrasound.

**Let talk about CTA...**

-   CTA is preferable due to higher spatial resolution than MRA, less
    dependence upon technical expertise, and a shorter scan time

-   Excellent diagnostic accuracy for FMD of the main renal arteries,
    although the sensitivity decreases when FMD is only present in the
    smaller branch renal arteries.

-   Multirow detector CT scanners, which offer more rapid image
    acquisition, variable section thickness, three-dimensional
    rendering, diminished helical artifacts, and smaller contrast
    requirements, may gain an increased role in the diagnosis and
    follow-up of renal artery FMD

**What about MRA?**

-   Inconsistent detection of FMD and is performed if CTA is
    contraindicated

-   The spatial resolution in the branch vessels is not adequate, and
    artifact may occur, suggesting "beading" when none is present.

-   May miss mild FMD.

-   Can be useful for detecting aneurysms and dissections

**And finally, Duplex ultrasonography**

-   Detects elevated blood flow velocities in the mid and distal
    portions of the renal artery, most common locations for FMD.

-   Increased peak systolic velocity, turbulent blood flow, and
    tortuosity of the mid and distal artery.

    -   \% diameter stenosis reports less helpful and usually inaccurate

-   lowest spatial resolution of all of the cross-sectional imaging
    modalities

-   most operator dependence

-   first choice only in high-volume centers with extensive expertise in
    this technique

**What about non invasive testing?**

-   DSA is performed in patients if there is a high clinical suspicion
    of FMD, and treatment with revascularization is planned if a
    stenosis is found.

    -   Can improve visualization of the arteries by eliminating
        background soft tissue and bone and has higher spatial
        resolution than any of the other imaging modalities

    -   Can measure the pressure gradient across the stenosis

        -   Pressure decrease threshold of 10 % or more of the mean
            pressure should be used to decide whether a lesion is
            hemodynamically significant

        -   IVUS and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be helpful
            in determining if a dissection or intramural hematoma is
            present as well as help to determine if angioplasty has
            improved the stenosis.

    -   Negative DSA excludes a diagnosis of FMD in the vascular bed
        that was imaged.

**Any place for pathologic diagnosis in modern therapy?**

-   Histopathology (and histologic classification) is **no longer** part
    of the diagnosis.

    -   Only in the rare patient who requires surgical revascularization
        or resection of an aneurysm.

**So how do we treat this, what warrants intervention and are those
interventions different than what we offer atherosclerotic disease of
the renal arteries?**

-   All patients with FMD should be placed on antiplatelet therapy (ASA)
    unless otherwise contraindicated

-   [Antihypertensive therapy]{.underline}

    -   Most patients will require antihypertensive therapy, even if
        they undergo revascularization.

    -   Majority of patients with **focal** FMD have their blood
        pressure cured with angoplasty

**But what about revascularization?**

-   [Revascularization]{.underline} Goal: control of hypertension

    -   BP can be controlled in most adults with multifocal FMD with a
        mean of two antihypertensive medications

    -   Weigh risks and benefits in well controlled hypertension.

-   **No** randomized trials comparing revascularization with medical
    therapy

**Well then who do we treat?**

-   Recent-onset hypertension, with goal to cure hypertension.

-   Resistant hypertension despite compliance with an appropriate
    three-drug regimen.

-   Patients unable to tolerate antihypertensive medications or who are
    noncompliant with their medication regimen.

-   Adults with bilateral renal FMD, or unilateral renal FMD to a single
    functioning kidney, and unexplained progressive renal insufficiency
    thought to result from renal artery stenosis

-   Hypertensive children.

-   may be at higher risk than adults for progressive renal parenchymal
    loss, and therefore could benefit from revascularization even if
    their hypertension can be well-controlled with one or two
    antihypertensive medications.

**And what kind of results do we get with revascularization?**

-   Hypertension is cured or improved following revascularization in a
    large proportion of patients with FMD.

    -   Much better than 2/2 atherosclerosis

    -   Varies considerably from study to study, although hypertension
        control improves in most patients and depends in large part upon
        the definition of cure.

    -   Not good data on stabilization of either GFR or renal size in
        patients with FMD.

What options do we have in terms of revascularization?

**Angioplasty and open surgery**

Do we have good results treating FMD with these?

-   Patients most often treated with angioplasty alone with good
    success. [@daviesLongtermOutcomesPercutaneous2008;
    @jenkinsOutcomesHypertensivePatients2015]

-   Improvement in blood pressure (including those with and without
    cure) was similar with PTA as compared with surgery (86 versus 88
    %).

-   Older age and longer duration of hypertension prior to
    revascularization were significantly associated with a lower cure
    rate.

**How do these compare?**

-   PTA achieves similar technical success and is associated with a
    lower risk of adverse events in observational studies

-   Most patients with FMD who are selected for renal revascularization
    have PTA rather than surgery

-   Major adverse events were more frequent with surgery (15 versus 6
    %).

**So why choose open surgery?**

-   Cure rates were higher with surgery (54 versus 36 %).

-   Surgery rather than PTA if PTA fails or if the arterial anatomy is
    not amenable to PTA

    -   Patients with small renal arteries (\<4 mm), with branch renal
        artery disease, or with extensive intimal fibroplasia.

**So how do we perform Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty** for FMD?

-   [Without]{.underline} stent placement... unlike PTA for
    atherosclerotic RAS

**Why not place a stent?**

-   Patients do very well with angioplasty alone, no reason to place a
    stent.

    -   Lesion is so fibrotic that the pressure gradient cannot be
        obliterated with an angioplasty, a stent will not correct this
        problem

        -   Such patients should be referred for surgery.

-   Usually have stenoses in the mid and distal portions of the artery
    rather than at the ostium or proximal portion (as occurs with
    atherosclerosis).

    -   Should surgical revascularization become necessary due, for
        example, to in-stent restenosis, patients may require more
        complex branch repair to bypass the occluded stent since the
        stent often covers the renal artery up to the point of the first
        intrarenal branch.

**Do we ever place stents?**

-   Stents placed when a dissection results from the performance of PTA
    or in the rare instance in which a perforation of the renal artery
    occurs during angioplasty.

**And we're getting good outcomes with PTA alone?**

-   Technical (angiographic) success rates for PTA 83-100

-   Rate of restenosis 12-34% over follow-up intervals of six months to
    two years

    -   Difficult to determine if patients with FMD develop restenosis,
        or if the lesion was not completely treated correctly the first
        time.

    -   Not necessarily associated with recurrent hypertension.

**But generally we can achieve significant and sustained reductions in
systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, and
number of antihypertensive agents.**

-   Systolic blood pressure response was better in patients with FMD
    affecting the main renal artery than in patients with branch vessel
    involvement.

**Any specific technical tips?**

-   Cutting balloon angioplasty should be avoided

    -   Increased risk of rupture

-   Post angioplasty visual inspection alone is **not** accurate.

    -   Measure pressure differential using a pressure guidewire, with a
        mean gradient of \<5 mmHg across the treated segment suggesting
        a satisfactory result

        -   Measure before and after angioplasty

    -   Post-procedure renal duplex scanning

        -   Degree of turbulence is less prominent, and velocity
            elevation in the mid-distal renal artery returns to normal.

    -   Intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography (OCT)
        is occasionally used to evaluate the elimination or reduction of
        various endoluminal defects.

**What should we do if it doesn't work?**

-   If either has no improvement in blood pressure or an initial
    improvement followed by recurrence, repeat angiogram and PTA.

    -   Restenosis may actually represent inadequate angioplasty during
        the first procedure

-   Persistent HTN despite technically successful PTA suggests that the
    cause of hypertension is unrelated to fibromuscular disease or is
    related to small vessel disease within the kidney (nephrosclerosis)
    due to longstanding hypertension.

**What kind of complications do we see after this?**

-   Mostly related to vascular access

-   Rarely: renal artery perforation, dissection, or segmental renal
    infarction may occur.

-   Decreasing over time- 16 % in 1998 to 3 % in 2001

**Ok, lets switch gears to open revascularization?**

-   Aortorenal bypass with a saphenous vein graft is the most common
    technique

    -   Artificial graft material used occasionally

**For everyone? What about for pediatric patients?**

-   Pediatric patients: hypogastric artery grafts are used or else
    aortic reimplantation of the renal artery is performed because vein
    grafts become aneurysmal

**How does this compare again to PTA?**

-   Similar success rates compared to PTA (82-89% patency) but with
    higher morbidity.

    -   Perioperative mortality appears to be very low (\~1.2%)

    -   Usually limited to complex cases so success and complication
        would probably be higher if simpler cases were included.

**What's Monitoring and follow-up look like for these patients?**

-   Medical management only:

    -   Renal artery stenosis and kidney dysfunction may progress
        despite good blood pressure control

        -   Mostly in patients with focal FMD and intimal fibroplasia

    -   Every patient with FMD should have measurement of serum
        creatinine and renal artery duplex ultrasound every 12 months.

**And After revascularization**?

-   Duplex ultrasonography and serum creatinine measurements performed
    on the first office visit post procedure, then every six months for
    two years, and then yearly, if stable.

-   With worsening on new hypertension, or unexplained increase in the
    serum creatinine, he or she should be imaged at that time with
    duplex ultrasound (or CTA if the ultrasound is equivocal or poor
    quality).

## Renal Artery Aneurysms

**Ok, that's a pretty good review, but let's switch gears and talk about
renal artery aneurysms**

### Demographics

-   Renal artery aneurysms are rare - Autopsy studies have revealed an
    incidence of 0.01% to 0.09%.

-   Females \> males, although females = males with FMD excluded

-   Although arteriosclerotic changes have been identified in most
    aneurysms in patients with multiple lesions, this is not a uniform
    finding, suggesting that arteriosclerosis may not be the most
    important factor in the genesis of renal artery aneurysms.

-   More likely due to a congenital medial degenerative process with
    weakness of the elastic lamina.

-   Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is often a direct contributor to the
    development of an aneurysm.

    -   Medial fibroplasia is typically associated with multiple
        stenoses and post-stenotic dilatation of the distal two thirds
        of the renal artery.

    -   Renal artery aneurysms in association with FMD are generally
        only a few millimeters in diameter.

    -   The typical angiographic appearance of a renal artery involved
        with medial fibroplasia is a "string of beads."

-   A rare cause of renal artery aneurysms is Ehlers-Danlos' syndrome.

    -   This disorder is associated with extreme arterial fragility and
        spontaneous rupture.

### Anatomy

-   Most frequent site of involvement is primary bifurcation,
    intraparenchymal (\<10%)

-   Most are saccular

-   Right slightly more common than left, bilateral 10%

-   90% are extraparenchymal

### Presentation

-   Majority are associated with hypertension (70%)
    [@colemanRenalArteryAneurysms2015]

-   10% mortality

-   90% risk of kidney loss

-   Less than 3% rupture.

### Management

**Size criteria currently controversial\***

-   Uncontrolled hypertension is an indication for repair when smaller
    than 2.5cm. [@colemanRenalArteryAneurysms2015]

-   VLFDC recently proposed a 3cm threshold for asymptomatic renal
    artery aneurysm. [@klausnerContemporaryManagementRenal2015]

-   Many aneurysms with circumferential calcification which could offer
    protection against rupture

In an elderly patient, observation of this aneurysm with Duplex
surveillance is the appropriate treatment.

For larger aneurysms in younger patients, aneurysmorrhaphy with primary
repair or patching, interposition grafting, or bypass can be performed
with low mortality. [@colemanRenalArteryAneurysms2015]

-   Comparison of ex vivo or insitu renal artery reconstruction have
    shown no difference in mortality, morbidity, LOS or reoperation.

Endovascular techniques such as coiling have been reported to be
successful in treating these saccular aneurysms; however, most aneurysms
occur at branch points making covered stent placement difficult.
[@colemanRenalArteryAneurysms2015]

-   Renal artery dissection caused by guide wires or catheters can
    occur, but is rare.

## Renal Artery Dissection

Renal ischemia if patient has new hypertension, flank pain, hematuria
and proteinuria. [@mullerSurgicalTreatmentRenal2003]

Endo avoided if branch involvement.

Bypass, in situ repair, auto-transplant if renal branch involvement and
possibility of renal salvage.

Nephrectomy required in uncontrolled hypertension, extensive dissection
and irreversable ischemia.

## Renal Vein Thrombosis

### Diagnosis

CT scan is best. Difficult to visualize native renal vein on duplex
imaging. [@asgharRenalVeinThrombosis2007;
@velazquez-ramirez129RenovascularDisease2019]

### Management

-   Renal vein thrombosis initially managed with heparin, then warfarin
    for 6mo. [[@asgharRenalVeinThrombosis2007;
    @velazquez-ramirez129RenovascularDisease2019]]

-   Thrombectomy or thrombolysis reserved for acutely threatened kidney
    in young patient, complication of AC or thrombosis of solitary
    kidney with renal failure.

-   Nephrectomy for post-infarct hemorrhage.

-   Thrombolysis requires areterial and venous access - venous access to
    debulk and arterial access to drip and clear small intra-paranchymal
    veins.

## Renal Arteriovenous Fistula

Relatively common complication of renal biopsy (9-18%).
[@schwarzCourseRelevanceArteriovenous2008]

Presentation - bruit over kidney, renal impairment, varicocele,
hematuria and abdominal pain. [@hunter174AcquiredArteriovenous2019]

Diagnose with duplex, CTA or MRA.

-   Duplex will show marked turbulence, elevated PSV and high end
    diastolic flow, low resistive index.
    [@ozbekImagedirectedColorDoppler1995]

Management

-   Indications for treatment [@merkusHighIncidenceArteriovenous2005;
    @morimotoUniqueCaseRenovascular1995]

    -   Gross hematuria requiring blood transfusion

    -   High output cardiac failure

    -   Worsening hypertension or renal failure

    -   Persistance at \>1yr

-   Treated most often with angiogram, covered stent or highly selective
    micro-coil embolization. [@ginatTranscatheterRenalArtery2009;
    @saliouIdiopathicRenalArteriovenous1998]
